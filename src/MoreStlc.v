(** * Simple Extensions to STLC *)

(** The simply typed lambda-calculus has enough structure to make its
    theoretical properties interesting, but it is not much of a
    programming language.  In this chapter, we begin to close the gap
    with real-world languages by introducing a number of familiar
    features that have straightforward treatments at the level of
    typing. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Numbers *)

(** As we saw in exercise [stlc_arith] at the end of the [StlcProp]
    chapter, adding types, constants, and primitive operations for
    numbers is easy -- basically just a matter of combining the
    [Types] and [Stlc] chapters. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Let Bindings *)

(** When writing a complex expression, it is useful to be able
    to give names to some of its subexpressions to avoid repetition
    and increase readability.  Most languages provide one or more ways
    of doing this.  In OCaml (and Coq), for example, we can write [let
    x=t1 in t2] to mean "reduce the expression [t1] to a value and
    bind the name [x] to this value while reducing [t2]."

    Our [let]-binder follows OCaml in choosing a standard
    _call-by-value_ evaluation order, where the [let]-bound term must
    be fully reduced before reduction of the [let]-body can begin.
    The typing rule [T_Let] tells us that the type of a [let] can be
    calculated by calculating the type of the [let]-bound term,
    extending the context with a binding with this type, and in this
    enriched context calculating the type of the body (which is then
    the type of the whole [let] expression).

    At this point in the book, it's probably easier simply to look at
    the rules defining this new feature than to wade through a lot of
    English text conveying the same information.  Here they are: *)

(** Syntax:

       t ::=                Terms
           | ...               (other terms same as before)
           | let x=t in t      let-binding
*)

(**
    Reduction:

                                 t1 ==> t1'
                     ----------------------------------               (ST_Let1)
                     let x=t1 in t2 ==> let x=t1' in t2

                        ----------------------------              (ST_LetValue)
                        let x=v1 in t2 ==> [x:=v1]t2

    Typing:

                Gamma |- t1 : T1      Gamma , x:T1 |- t2 : T2
                --------------------------------------------            (T_Let)
                        Gamma |- let x=t1 in t2 : T2
*)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Pairs *)

(** Our functional programming examples in Coq have made
    frequent use of _pairs_ of values.  The type of such a pair is
    called a _product type_.

    The formalization of pairs is almost too simple to be worth
    discussing.  However, let's look briefly at the various parts of
    the definition to emphasize the common pattern. *)

(** In Coq, the primitive way of extracting the components of a pair
    is _pattern matching_.  An alternative style is to take [fst] and
    [snd] -- the first- and second-projection operators -- as
    primitives.  Just for fun, let's do our products this way.  For
    example, here's how we'd write a function that takes a pair of
    numbers and returns the pair of their sum and difference:

       \x:Nat*Nat.
          let sum = x.fst + x.snd in
          let diff = x.fst - x.snd in
          (sum,diff)
*)

(** Adding pairs to the simply typed lambda-calculus, then, involves
    adding two new forms of term -- pairing, written [(t1,t2)], and
    projection, written [t.fst] for the first projection from [t] and
    [t.snd] for the second projection -- plus one new type constructor,
    [T1*T2], called the _product_ of [T1] and [T2].  *)

(** Syntax:

       t ::=                Terms
           | (t,t)             pair
           | t.fst             first projection
           | t.snd             second projection
           | ...

       v ::=                Values
           | (v,v)             pair value
           | ...

       T ::=                Types
           | T * T             product type
           | ...
*)

(** For reduction, we need several new rules specifying how pairs and
    projection behave.

                              t1 ==> t1'
                         --------------------                        (ST_Pair1)
                         (t1,t2) ==> (t1',t2)

                              t2 ==> t2'
                         --------------------                        (ST_Pair2)
                         (v1,t2) ==> (v1,t2')

                              t1 ==> t1'
                          ------------------                          (ST_Fst1)
                          t1.fst ==> t1'.fst

                          ------------------                       (ST_FstPair)
                          (v1,v2).fst ==> v1

                              t1 ==> t1'
                          ------------------                          (ST_Snd1)
                          t1.snd ==> t1'.snd

                          ------------------                       (ST_SndPair)
                          (v1,v2).snd ==> v2
*)

(** Rules [ST_FstPair] and [ST_SndPair] say that, when a fully
    reduced pair meets a first or second projection, the result is
    the appropriate component.  The congruence rules [ST_Fst1] and
    [ST_Snd1] allow reduction to proceed under projections, when the
    term being projected from has not yet been fully reduced.
    [ST_Pair1] and [ST_Pair2] reduce the parts of pairs: first the
    left part, and then -- when a value appears on the left -- the right
    part.  The ordering arising from the use of the metavariables [v]
    and [t] in these rules enforces a left-to-right evaluation
    strategy for pairs.  (Note the implicit convention that
    metavariables like [v] and [v1] can only denote values.)  We've
    also added a clause to the definition of values, above, specifying
    that [(v1,v2)] is a value.  The fact that the components of a pair
    value must themselves be values ensures that a pair passed as an
    argument to a function will be fully reduced before the function
    body starts executing. *)

(** The typing rules for pairs and projections are straightforward.

               Gamma |- t1 : T1       Gamma |- t2 : T2
               ---------------------------------------                 (T_Pair)
                       Gamma |- (t1,t2) : T1*T2

                        Gamma |- t1 : T11*T12
                        ---------------------                           (T_Fst)
                        Gamma |- t1.fst : T11

                        Gamma |- t1 : T11*T12
                        ---------------------                           (T_Snd)
                        Gamma |- t1.snd : T12
*)

(** [T_Pair] says that [(t1,t2)] has type [T1*T2] if [t1] has
   type [T1] and [t2] has type [T2].  Conversely, [T_Fst] and [T_Snd]
   tell us that, if [t1] has a product type [T11*T12] (i.e., if it
   will reduce to a pair), then the types of the projections from
   this pair are [T11] and [T12]. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Unit *)

(** Another handy base type, found especially in languages in
    the ML family, is the singleton type [Unit]. *)
(** It has a single element -- the term constant [unit] (with a small
    [u]) -- and a typing rule making [unit] an element of [Unit].  We
    also add [unit] to the set of possible values -- indeed, [unit] is
    the _only_ possible result of reducing an expression of type
    [Unit]. *)

(** Syntax:

       t ::=                Terms
           | unit              unit value
           | ...

       v ::=                Values
           | unit              unit
           | ...

       T ::=                Types
           | Unit              Unit type
           | ...

    Typing:

                         --------------------                          (T_Unit)
                         Gamma |- unit : Unit
*)

(** It may seem a little strange to bother defining a type that
    has just one element -- after all, wouldn't every computation
    living in such a type be trivial?

    This is a fair question, and indeed in the STLC the [Unit] type is
    not especially critical (though we'll see two uses for it below).
    Where [Unit] really comes in handy is in richer languages with
    _side effects_ -- e.g., assignment statements that mutate
    variables or pointers, exceptions and other sorts of nonlocal
    control structures, etc.  In such languages, it is convenient to
    have a type for the (trivial) result of an expression that is
    evaluated only for its effect. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Sums *)

(** Many programs need to deal with values that can take two distinct
   forms.  For example, we might identify employees in an accounting
   application using using _either_ their name _or_ their id number.
   A search function might return _either_ a matching value _or_ an
   error code.

   These are specific examples of a binary _sum type_ (sometimes called
   a _disjoint union_), which describes a set of values drawn from 
   one of two given types, e.g.:

       Nat + Bool
*)

(** We create elements of these types by _tagging_ elements of
    the component types.  For example, if [n] is a [Nat] then [inl n]
    is an element of [Nat+Bool]; similarly, if [b] is a [Bool] then
    [inr b] is a [Nat+Bool].  The names of the tags [inl] and [inr]
    arise from thinking of them as functions

   inl : Nat -> Nat + Bool
   inr : Bool -> Nat + Bool

    that "inject" elements of [Nat] or [Bool] into the left and right
    components of the sum type [Nat+Bool].  (But note that we don't
    actually treat them as functions in the way we formalize them:
    [inl] and [inr] are keywords, and [inl t] and [inr t] are primitive
    syntactic forms, not function applications.) *)

(** In general, the elements of a type [T1 + T2] consist of the
    elements of [T1] tagged with the token [inl], plus the elements of
    [T2] tagged with [inr]. *)

(** One important usage of sums is signaling errors:

    div : Nat -> Nat -> (Nat + Unit) =
    div =
      \x:Nat. \y:Nat.
        if iszero y then
          inr unit
        else
          inl ...

    The type [Nat + Unit] above is in fact isomorphic to [option nat]
    in Coq, and we've already seen how to signal errors with options. *)

(** To _use_ elements of sum types, we introduce a [case]
    construct (a very simplified form of Coq's [match]) to destruct
    them. For example, the following procedure converts a [Nat+Bool]
    into a [Nat]: *)
(** 
    getNat =
      \x:Nat+Bool.
        case x of
          inl n => n
        | inr b => if b then 1 else 0
*)

(** More formally... *)

(** Syntax:

       t ::=                Terms
           | inl T t           tagging (left)
           | inr T t           tagging (right)
           | case t of         case
               inl x => t
             | inr x => t
           | ...

    We use the type annotation in [inl] and [inr] to make the typing 
    relation simpler, similarly to what we did for functions. *)

(** Without this extra information, the typing rule [T_Inl], for
    example, would have to say that, once we have shown that [t1] is
    an element of type [T1], we can derive that [inl t1] is an element
    of [T1 + T2] for _any_ type T2.  For example, we could derive both
    [inl 5 : Nat + Nat] and [inl 5 : Nat + Bool] (and infinitely many
    other types).  This peculiarity (technically, a failure of
    uniqueness of types) would mean that we cannot build a
    typechecking algorithm simply by "reading the rules from bottom to
    top" as we could for all the other features seen so far.

    There are various ways to deal with this difficulty.  One simple
    one -- which we've adopted here -- forces the programmer to
    explicitly annotate the "other side" of a sum type when performing
    an injection.  This is a bit heavy for programmers (so real
    languages adopt other solutions), but it is easy to understand and
    formalize. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Lists *)

(** The typing features we have seen can be classified into _base
    types_ like [Bool], and _type constructors_ like [->] and [*] that
    build new types from old ones.  Another useful type constructor is
    [List].  For every type [T], the type [List T] describes
    finite-length lists whose elements are drawn from [T].

    In principle, we could encode lists using pairs, sums and
    _recursive_ types. But giving semantics to recursive types is
    non-trivial. Instead, we'll just discuss the special case of lists
    directly.

    Below we give the syntax, semantics, and typing rules for lists.
    Except for the fact that explicit type annotations are mandatory
    on [nil] and cannot appear on [cons], these lists are essentially
    identical to those we built in Coq.  We use [lcase] to destruct
    lists, to avoid dealing with questions like "what is the [head] of
    the empty list?" *)

(** For example, here is a function that calculates the sum of
    the first two elements of a list of numbers:

      \x:List Nat.
      lcase x of nil -> 0
         | a::x' -> lcase x' of nil -> a
                       | b::x'' -> a+b

(** ** General Recursion *)

(** Another facility found in most programming languages (including
    Coq) is the ability to define recursive functions.  For example,
    we might like to be able to define the factorial function like
    this:

      fact = \x:Nat.
                if x=0 then 1 else x * (fact (pred x)))

   Formalizing such a definition mechanism can be done, but it requires 
   some effort: we'd have to introduce a notion of "function definitions" 
   and carry around an "environment" of such definitions in the definition 
   of the [step] relation. *)

(** Here is another way that is straightforward to formalize: instead
    of writing recursive definitions where the right-hand side can
    contain the identifier being defined, we can define a _fixed-point
    operator_ that performs the "unfolding" of the recursive definition
    in the right-hand side as needed, during reduction.

   fact =
       fix
         (\f:Nat->Nat.
            \x:Nat.
               if x=0 then 1 else x * (f (pred x)))
*)

(** The intuition is that the higher-order function [f] passed
    to [fix] is a _generator_ for the [fact] function: if [f] is
    applied to a function that approximates the desired behavior of
    [fact] up to some number [n] (that is, a function that returns
    correct results on inputs less than or equal to [n]), then it
    returns a better approximation to [fact] -- a function that
    returns correct results for inputs up to [n+1].  Applying [fix] to
    this generator returns its _fixed point_ -- a function that gives
    the desired behavior for all inputs [n].

    (The term "fixed point" has exactly the same sense as in ordinary
    mathematics, where a fixed point of a function [f] is an input [x]
    such that [f(x) = x].  Here, a fixed point of a function [F] of
    type (say) [(Nat->Nat)->(Nat->Nat)] is a function [f] of type
    [Nat->Nat] such that [F f] is behaviorally equivalent to [f].) *)

(** Syntax:

       t ::=                Terms
           | fix t             fixed-point operator
           | ...

   Reduction:

                                t1 ==> t1'
                            ------------------                        (ST_Fix1)
                            fix t1 ==> fix t1'

                              F = \xf:T1.t2
                         -----------------------                    (ST_FixAbs)
                         fix F ==> [xf:=fix F]t2

   Typing:

                           Gamma |- t1 : T1->T1
                           --------------------                         (T_Fix)
                           Gamma |- fix t1 : T1
*)

(** Let's see how [ST_FixAbs] works by reducing [fact 3 = fix F 3],
    where [F = (\f. \x. if x=0 then 1 else x * (f (pred x)))] (we are
    omitting type annotations for brevity here).

(** Write down the sequence of steps that the term [fact 1] goes

    (* FILL IN HERE *)
[]
*)

(** The ability to form the fixed point of a function of type [T->T]
    for any [T] has some surprising consequences.  In particular, it
    implies that _every_ type is inhabited by some term.  To see this,
    observe that, for every type [T], we can define the term

    fix (\x:T.x)

    By [T_Fix]  and [T_Abs], this term has type [T].  By [ST_FixAbs]
    it reduces to itself, over and over again.  Thus it is an
    _undefined element_ of [T].

    More usefully, here's an example using [fix] to define a
    two-argument recursive function:

    equal =
      fix
        (\eq:Nat->Nat->Bool.
           \m:Nat. \n:Nat.
             if m=0 then iszero n
             else if n=0 then false
             else eq (pred m) (pred n))


    And finally, here is an example where [fix] is used to define a
    _pair_ of recursive functions (illustrating the fact that the type
    [T1] in the rule [T_Fix] need not be a function type):

      evenodd =
        fix
          (\eo: (Nat->Bool * Nat->Bool).
             let e = \n:Nat. if n=0 then true  else eo.snd (pred n) in
             let o = \n:Nat. if n=0 then false else eo.fst (pred n) in
             (e,o))

      even = evenodd.fst
      odd  = evenodd.snd
*)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Records *)

(** As a final example of a basic extension of the STLC, let's look
    briefly at how to define _records_ and their types.  Intuitively,
    records can be obtained from pairs by two straightforward
    generalizations: they are n-ary products (rather than just binary)
    and their fields are accessed by _label_ (rather than
    position). *)

(** Syntax:

       t ::=                          Terms
           | {i1=t1, ..., in=tn}         record
           | t.i                         projection
           | ...

       v ::=                          Values
           | {i1=v1, ..., in=vn}         record value
           | ...

       T ::=                          Types
           | {i1:T1, ..., in:Tn}         record type
           | ...

   Intuitively, the generalization from products is pretty obvious.  But 
   it's worth noticing the ways in which what we've actually written is
   even more informal than the informal syntax we've used in previous 
   sections and chapters: we've used "[...]" in several places to mean "any
   number of these," and we've omitted explicit mention of the usual
   side-condition that the labels of a record should not contain
   repetitions. *)

(**
   Reduction:

                              ti ==> ti'
                 ------------------------------------                  (ST_Rcd)
                     {i1=v1, ..., im=vm, in=ti, ...}
                 ==> {i1=v1, ..., im=vm, in=ti', ...}

                              t1 ==> t1'
                            --------------                           (ST_Proj1)
                            t1.i ==> t1'.i

                      -------------------------                    (ST_ProjRcd)
                      {..., i=vi, ...}.i ==> vi

   Again, these rules are a bit informal.  For example, the first rule
   is intended to be read "if [ti] is the leftmost field that is not a
   value and if [ti] steps to [ti'], then the whole record steps..."
   In the last rule, the intention is that there should only be one
   field called i, and that all the other fields must contain values. *)

(**
   The typing rules are simple:

            Gamma |- t1 : T1     ...     Gamma |- tn : Tn
          --------------------------------------------------            (T_Rcd)
          Gamma |- {i1=t1, ..., in=tn} : {i1:T1, ..., in:Tn}

                    Gamma |- t : {..., i:Ti, ...}
                    -----------------------------                      (T_Proj)
                          Gamma |- t.i : Ti
*)

(** There are several ways to approach formalizing the above
    definitions.

      - We can directly formalize the syntactic forms and inference
        rules, staying as close as possible to the form we've given
        them above.  This is conceptually straightforward, and it's
        probably what we'd want to do if we were building a real
        compiler (in particular, it will allow us to print error
        messages in the form that programmers will find easy to
        understand).  But the formal versions of the rules will not be
        very pretty or easy to work with, because all the [...]s above
        will have to be replaced with explicit quantifications or
        comprehensions.  For this reason, records are not included in
        the extended exercise at the end of this chapter.  (It is
        still useful to discuss them informally here because they will
        help motivate the addition of subtyping to the type system
        when we get to the [Sub] chapter.)

      - Alternatively, we could look for a smoother way of presenting
        records -- for example, a binary presentation with one
        constructor for the empty record and another constructor for
        adding a single field to an existing record, instead of a
        single monolithic constructor that builds a whole record at
        once.  This is the right way to go if we are primarily
        interested in studying the metatheory of the calculi with
        records, since it leads to clean and elegant definitions and
        proofs.  Chapter [Records] shows how this can be done.

      - Finally, if we like, we can avoid formalizing records
        altogether, by stipulating that record notations are just
        informal shorthands for more complex expressions involving
        pairs and product types.  We sketch this approach in the next
        section. *)

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Encoding Records (Optional) *)

(** First, observe that we can encode arbitrary-size tuples using
    nested pairs and the [unit] value.  To avoid overloading the pair
    notation [(t1,t2)], we'll use curly braces without labels to write
    down tuples, so [{}] is the empty tuple, [{5}] is a singleton
    tuple, [{5,6}] is a 2-tuple (morally the same as a pair),
    [{5,6,7}] is a triple, etc.

      {}                 ---->  unit
      {t1, t2, ..., tn}  ---->  (t1, trest)
                                where {t2, ..., tn} ----> trest

    Similarly, we can encode tuple types using nested product types:

      {}                 ---->  Unit
      {T1, T2, ..., Tn}  ---->  T1 * TRest
                                where {T2, ..., Tn} ----> TRest

    The operation of projecting a field from a tuple can be encoded
    using a sequence of second projections followed by a first projection:

      t.0        ---->  t.fst
      t.(n+1)    ---->  (t.snd).n

    Next, suppose that there is some total ordering on record labels,
    so that we can associate each label with a unique natural number.
    This number is called the _position_ of the label.  For example,
    we might assign positions like this:

      LABEL   POSITION
      a       0
      b       1
      c       2
      ...     ...
      bar     1395
      ...     ...
      foo     4460
      ...     ...

    We use these positions to encode record values as tuples (i.e., as
    nested pairs) by sorting the fields according to their positions.
    For example:

      {a=5, b=6}      ---->   {5,6}
      {a=5, c=7}      ---->   {5,unit,7}
      {c=7, a=5}      ---->   {5,unit,7}
      {c=5, b=3}      ---->   {unit,3,5}
      {f=8,c=5,a=7}   ---->   {7,unit,5,unit,unit,8}
      {f=8,c=5}       ---->   {unit,unit,5,unit,unit,8}

    Note that each field appears in the position associated with its
    label, that the size of the tuple is determined by the label with
    the highest position, and that we fill in unused positions with
    [unit].

    We do exactly the same thing with record types:

      {a:Nat, b:Nat}      ---->   {Nat,Nat}
      {c:Nat, a:Nat}      ---->   {Nat,Unit,Nat}
      {f:Nat,c:Nat}       ---->   {Unit,Unit,Nat,Unit,Unit,Nat}

    Finally, record projection is encoded as a tuple projection from
    the appropriate position:

      t.l  ---->  t.(position of l)

    It is not hard to check that all the typing rules for the original
    "direct" presentation of records are validated by this
    encoding.  (The reduction rules are "almost validated" -- not
    quite, because the encoding reorders fields.) *)

(** Of course, this encoding will not be very efficient if we
    happen to use a record with label [foo]!  But things are not
    actually as bad as they might seem: for example, if we assume that
    our compiler can see the whole program at the same time, we can
    _choose_ the numbering of labels so that we assign small positions
    to the most frequently used labels.  Indeed, there are industrial
    compilers that essentially do this! *)

(* ----------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** *** Variants (Optional) *)

(** Just as products can be generalized to records, sums can be
    generalized to n-ary labeled types called _variants_.  Instead of
    [T1+T2], we can write something like [<l1:T1,l2:T2,...ln:Tn>]
    where [l1],[l2],... are field labels which are used both to build
    instances and as case arm labels.

    These n-ary variants give us almost enough mechanism to build
    arbitrary inductive data types like lists and trees from
    scratch -- the only thing missing is a way to allow _recursion_ in
    type definitions.  We won't cover this here, but detailed
    treatments can be found in many textbooks -- e.g., Types and
    Programming Languages. *)

(** * Exercise: Formalizing the Extensions *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars (STLC_extensions)  *)
(** In this exercise, you will formalize some of the extensions
    described in this chapter.  We've provided the necessary additions
    to the syntax of terms and types, and we've included a few
    examples that you can test your definitions with to make sure they
    are working as expected.  You'll fill in the rest of the
    definitions and extend all the proofs accordingly.

    To get you started, we've provided implementations for:
     - numbers
     - pairs and units
     - sums
     - lists

    You need to complete the implementations for:
     - let (which involves binding)
     - [fix]

    A good strategy is to work on the extensions one at a time, in two
    passes, rather than trying to work through the file from start to
    finish in a single pass.  For each definition or proof, begin by
    reading carefully through the parts that are provided for you,
    referring to the text in the [Stlc] chapter for high-level
    intuitions and the embedded comments for detailed mechanics. *)

(** This section presents formalized versions of the examples from

    specific features; you can use these to make sure your definition
    of a given feature is reasonable before moving on to extending the
    proofs later in the file with the cases relating to this feature.
    The later examples require all the features together, so you'll
    need to come back to these when you've got all the definitions
    filled in. *)

(** *** Preliminaries *)

(** First, let's define a few variable names: *)

Notation a := (Id 0).
Notation f := (Id 1).
Notation g := (Id 2).
Notation l := (Id 3).
Notation k := (Id 6).
Notation i1 := (Id 7).
Notation i2 := (Id 8).
Notation x := (Id 9).
Notation y := (Id 10).
Notation processSum := (Id 11).
Notation n := (Id 12).
Notation eq := (Id 13).
Notation m := (Id 14).
Notation evenodd := (Id 15).
Notation even := (Id 16).
Notation odd := (Id 17).
Notation eo := (Id 18).

(** Next, a bit of Coq hackery to automate searching for typing
    derivations.  You don't need to understand this bit in detail --
    just have a look over it so that you'll know what to look for if
    you ever find yourself needing to make custom extensions to
    [auto].

    The following [Hint] declarations say that, whenever [auto]
    arrives at a goal of the form [(Gamma |- (tapp e1 e1) \in T)], it
    should consider [eapply T_App], leaving an existential variable
    for the middle type T1, and similar for [lcase]. That variable
    will then be filled in during the search for type derivations for
    [e1] and [e2].  We also include a hint to "try harder" when
    solving equality goals; this is useful to automate uses of
    [T_Var] (which includes an equality as a precondition). *)

   you've defined the [T_Lcase] constructor for the typing
