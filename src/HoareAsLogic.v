(** * HoareAsLogic: Hoare Logic as a Logic *)

(** The presentation of Hoare logic in chapter [Hoare] could be
    described as "model-theoretic": the proof rules for each of the
    constructors were presented as _theorems_ about the evaluation
    behavior of programs, and proofs of program correctness (validity
    of Hoare triples) were constructed by combining these theorems
    directly in Coq.

    Another way of presenting Hoare logic is to define a completely
    separate proof system -- a set of axioms and inference rules that
    talk about commands, Hoare triples, etc. -- and then say that a
    proof of a Hoare triple is a valid derivation in _that_ logic.  We
    can do this by giving an inductive definition of _valid
    derivations_ in this new logic.

    This chapter is optional.  Before reading it, you'll want to read
    the [ProofObjects] chapter. *)

    We can use Coq's tactics to help us construct the proof object. *)

(** We can also use Coq's reasoning facilities to prove metatheorems
    about Hoare Logic.  For example, here are the analogs of two
    theorems we saw in chapter [Hoare] -- this time expressed in terms
    of the syntax of Hoare Logic derivations (provability) rather than
    directly in terms of the semantics of Hoare triples.

    The first one says that, for every [P] and [c], the assertion
    [{{P}} c {{True}}] is _provable_ in Hoare Logic.  Note that the
    proof is more complex than the semantic proof in [Hoare]: we
    actually need to perform an induction over the structure of the
    command [c]. *)

(** As a last step, we can show that the set of [hoare_proof] axioms
    is sufficient to prove any true fact about (partial) correctness.
    More precisely, any semantic Hoare triple that we can prove can
    also be proved from these axioms.  Such a set of axioms is said to
    be _relatively complete_.  Our proof is inspired by this one:

      http://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/courses/sem-ws11/script/Hoare.html

    To carry out the proof, we need to invent some intermediate
    assertions using a technical device known as _weakest
    preconditions_.  Given a command [c] and a desired postcondition
    assertion [Q], the weakest precondition [wp c Q] is an assertion
    [P] such that [{{P}} c {{Q}}] holds, and moreover, for any other
    assertion [P'], if [{{P'}} c {{Q}}] holds then [P' -> P].  We can
    more directly define this as follows: *)

Definition wp (c:com) (Q:Assertion) : Assertion :=
  fun s => forall s', c / s \\ s' -> Q s'.

     eapply IHc2. intros st st' E1 H. apply H; assumption.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.

(** Finally, we might hope that our axiomatic Hoare logic is
    _decidable_; that is, that there is an (terminating) algorithm (a
    _decision procedure_) that can determine whether or not a given
    Hoare triple is valid (derivable).  But such a decision procedure
    cannot exist!

    Consider the triple [{{True}} c {{False}}]. This triple is valid
    if and only if [c] is non-terminating.  So any algorithm that
    could determine validity of arbitrary triples could solve the
    Halting Problem.

    Similarly, the triple [{{True} SKIP {{P}}] is valid if and only if
    [forall s, P s] is valid, where [P] is an arbitrary assertion of
    Coq's logic. But it is known that there can be no decision
    procedure for this logic. 

    Overall, this axiomatic style of presentation gives a clearer
    picture of what it means to "give a proof in Hoare logic."
    However, it is not entirely satisfactory from the point of view of
    writing down such proofs in practice: it is quite verbose.  The
    section of chapter [Hoare2] on formalizing decorated programs
    shows how we can do even better. *)
