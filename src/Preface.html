 This electronic book is a course on <i>Software Foundations</i>, the
    mathematical underpinnings of reliable software.  Topics include
    basic concepts of logic, computer-assisted theorem proving, the
    Coq proof assistant, functional programming, operational
    semantics, Hoare logic, and static type systems.  The exposition
    is intended for a broad range of readers, from advanced
    undergraduates to PhD students and researchers.  No specific
    background in logic or programming languages is assumed, though a
    degree of mathematical maturity will be helpful.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The principal novelty of the course is that it is one hundred
    percent formalized and machine-checked: the entire text is
    literally a script for Coq.  It is intended to be read
    alongside (or inside) an interactive session with Coq.  All the
    details in the text are fully formalized in Coq, and most of the
    exercises are designed to be worked using Coq.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The files are organized into a sequence of core chapters, covering
    about one semester's worth of material and organized into a
    coherent linear narrative, plus a number of "offshoot" chapters
    covering additional topics.  All the core chapters are suitable
    for both upper-level undergraduate and graduate students.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Building reliable software is hard.  The scale and complexity of
    modern systems, the number of people involved in building them,
    and the range of demands placed on them make it extremely
    difficult to build software that is even more-or-less correct,
    much less 100% correct.  At the same time, the increasing degree
    to which information processing is woven into every aspect of
    society greatly amplifies the cost of bugs and insecurities.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Computer scientists and software engineers have responded to these
    challenges by developing a whole host of techniques for improving
    software reliability, ranging from recommendations about managing
    software projects teams (e.g., extreme programming) to design
    philosophies for libraries (e.g., model-view-controller,
    publish-subscribe, etc.) and programming languages (e.g.,
    object-oriented programming, aspect-oriented programming,
    functional programming, ...) to mathematical techniques for
    specifying and reasoning about properties of software and tools
    for helping validate these properties.  The present course is
    focused on this last set of techniques.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The text weaves together five conceptual threads:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    (1) basic tools from <i>logic</i> for making and justifying precise
        claims about programs;

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    (2) the use of <i>proof assistants</i> to construct rigorous logical
        arguments;

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    (3) <i>functional programming</i>, both as a method of programming that
        simplifies reasoning about programs and as a bridge between
        programming and logic;

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    (4) formal techniques for <i>reasoning about the properties of
        specific programs</i> (e.g., the fact that a sorting function or
        a compiler obeys some formal specification); and

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    (5) the use of <i>type systems</i> for establishing well-behavedness
        guarantees for <i>all</i> programs in a given programming
        language (e.g., the fact that well-typed Java programs cannot
        be subverted at runtime).

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Each of these is easily rich enough to fill a whole course in its
    own right, and tackling all of them together naturally means that
    much will be left unsaid.  Nevertheless, we hope readers will find
    that these themes illuminate and amplify each other and that
    bringing them together creates a good foundation for digging into
    any of them more deeply.  Some suggestions for further reading can
    be found in the <a href="Postscript.html"><span class="inlineref">Postscript</span></a> chapter.  Bibliographic
    information for all cited works can be found in the file

<a name="lab3"></a><h2 class="section">Logic</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Logic is the field of study whose subject matter is <i>proofs</i> &mdash;
    unassailable arguments for the truth of particular propositions.
    Volumes have been written about the central role of logic in
    computer science.  Manna and Waldinger called it "the calculus of
    computer science," while Halpern et al.'s paper <i>On the Unusual
    Effectiveness of Logic in Computer Science</i> catalogs scores of
    ways in which logic offers critical tools and insights.  Indeed,
    they observe that, "As a matter of fact, logic has turned out to
    be significiantly more effective in computer science than it has
    been in mathematics.  This is quite remarkable, especially since
    much of the impetus for the development of logic during the past
    one hundred years came from mathematics."

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    In particular, the fundamental tools of <i>inductive proof</i> are
    ubiquitous in all of computer science.  You have surely seen them
    before, perhaps in a course on discrete math or analysis of
    algorithms, but in this course we will examine them much more
    deeply than you have probably done so far. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab4"></a><h2 class="section">Proof Assistants</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The flow of ideas between logic and computer science has not been
    unidirectional: CS has also made important contributions to logic.
    One of these has been the development of software tools for
    helping construct proofs of logical propositions.  These tools
    fall into two broad categories:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> <i>Automated theorem provers</i> provide "push-button" operation:
         you give them a proposition and they return either <i>true</i> or
         <i>false</i> (or, sometimes, <i>don't know: ran out of time</i>).
         Although their capabilities are still limited to specific
         domains, they have matured tremendously in recent years and
         are used now in a multitude of settings.  Examples of such
         tools include SAT solvers, SMT solvers, and model checkers.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> <i>Proof assistants</i> are hybrid tools that automate the more
         routine aspects of building proofs while depending on human
         guidance for more difficult aspects.  Widely used proof
         assistants include Isabelle, Agda, Twelf, ACL2, PVS, and Coq,
         among many others.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    This course is based around Coq, a proof assistant that has been
    under development since 1983 and that in recent years has
    attracted a large community of users in both research and
    industry.  Coq provides a rich environment for interactive
    development of machine-checked formal reasoning.  The kernel of
    the Coq system is a simple proof-checker, which guarantees that
    only correct deduction steps are ever performed.  On top of this
    kernel, the Coq environment provides high-level facilities for
    proof development, including a large library of common definitions
    and lemmas, powerful tactics for constructing complex proofs
    semi-automatically, and a special-purpose programming language for
    defining new proof-automation tactics for specific situations.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Coq has been a critical enabler for a huge variety of work across
    computer science and mathematics:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> As a <i>platform for modeling programming languages</i>, it has
      become a standard tool for researchers who need to describe and
      reason about complex language definitions.  It has been used,
      for example, to check the security of the JavaCard platform,
      obtaining the highest level of common criteria certification,
      and for formal specifications of the x<sub>86</sub> and LLVM instruction
      sets and programming languages such as C.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> As an <i>environment for developing formally certified software
      and hardware</i>, Coq has been used, for example, to build
      CompCert, a fully-verified optimizing compiler for C, and
      CertiKos, a fully verified hypervisor, for proving the
      correctness of subtle algorithms involving floating point
      numbers, and as the basis for CertiCrypt, an environment for
      reasoning about the security of cryptographic algorithms.  It is
      also being used to build verified implementations of the
      open-source RISC-V processor.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> As a <i>realistic environment for functional programming with
      dependent types</i>, it has inspired numerous innovations.  For
      example, the Ynot system embeds "relational Hoare reasoning" (an
      extension of the <i>Hoare Logic</i> we will see later in this course)
      in Coq.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> As a <i>proof assistant for higher-order logic</i>, it has been used
      to validate a number of important results in mathematics.  For
      example, its ability to include complex computations inside
      proofs made it possible to develop the first formally verified
      proof of the 4-color theorem.  This proof had previously been
      controversial among mathematicians because part of it included
      checking a large number of configurations using a program. In
      the Coq formalization, everything is checked, including the
      correctness of the computational part.  More recently, an even
      more massive effort led to a Coq formalization of the
      Feit-Thompson Theorem &mdash; the first major step in the
      classification of finite simple groups.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

   By the way, in case you're wondering about the name, here's what
   the official Coq web site at INRIA (the French national research
   lab where Coq has mostly been developed) says about it: "Some
   French computer scientists have a tradition of naming their
   software as animal species: Caml, Elan, Foc or Phox are examples of
   this tacit convention. In French, 'coq' means rooster, and it
   sounds like the initials of the Calculus of Constructions (CoC) on
   which it is based."  The rooster is also the national symbol of
   France, and C-o-q are the first three letters of the name of
   Thierry Coquand, one of Coq's early developers. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab5"></a><h2 class="section">Functional Programming</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The term <i>functional programming</i> refers both to a collection of
    programming idioms that can be used in almost any programming
    language and to a family of programming languages designed to
    emphasize these idioms, including Haskell, OCaml, Standard ML,
    F#, Scala, Scheme, Racket, Common Lisp, Clojure, Erlang, and Coq.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Functional programming has been developed over many decades &mdash;
    indeed, its roots go back to Church's lambda-calculus, which was
    invented in the 1930s, well before the first computers (at least
    the first electronic ones)!  But since the early '90s it has
    enjoyed a surge of interest among industrial engineers and
    language designers, playing a key role in high-value systems at
    companies like Jane St. Capital, Microsoft, Facebook, and
    Ericsson.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The most basic tenet of functional programming is that, as much as
    possible, computation should be <i>pure</i>, in the sense that the only
    effect of execution should be to produce a result: it should be
    free from <i>side effects</i> such as I/O, assignments to mutable
    variables, redirecting pointers, etc.  For example, whereas an
    <i>imperative</i> sorting function might take a list of numbers and
    rearrange its pointers to put the list in order, a pure sorting
    function would take the original list and return a <i>new</i> list
    containing the same numbers in sorted order.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    A significant benefit of this style of programming is that it
    makes programs easier to understand and reason about.  If every
    operation on a data structure yields a new data structure, leaving
    the old one intact, then there is no need to worry about how that
    structure is being shared and whether a change by one part of the
    program might break an invariant that another part of the program
    relies on.  These considerations are particularly critical in
    concurrent systems, where every piece of mutable state that is
    shared between threads is a potential source of pernicious bugs.
    Indeed, a large part of the recent interest in functional
    programming in industry is due to its simpler behavior in the
    presence of concurrency.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Another reason for the current excitement about functional
    programming is related to the first: functional programs are often
    much easier to parallelize than their imperative counterparts.  If
    running a computation has no effect other than producing a result,
    then it does not matter <i>where</i> it is run.  Similarly, if a data
    structure is never modified destructively, then it can be copied
    freely, across cores or across the network.  Indeed, the
    "Map-Reduce" idiom, which lies at the heart of massively
    distributed query processors like Hadoop and is used by Google to
    index the entire web is a classic example of functional
    programming.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    For purposes of this course, functional programming has yet
    another significant attraction: it serves as a bridge between
    logic and computer science.  Indeed, Coq itself can be viewed as a
    combination of a small but extremely expressive functional
    programming language plus a set of tools for stating and proving
    logical assertions.  Moreover, when we come to look more closely,
    we find that these two sides of Coq are actually aspects of the
    very same underlying machinery &mdash; i.e., <i>proofs are programs</i>.  
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab6"></a><h2 class="section">Program Verification</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Approximately the first third of <i>Software Foundations</i> is devoted
    to developing the conceptual framework of logic and functional
    programming and gaining enough fluency with Coq to use it for
    modeling and reasoning about nontrivial artifacts.  In the middle
    third, we turn our attention to two broad topics of critical
    importance in building reliable software (and hardware):
    techniques for proving specific properties of particular
    <i>programs</i> and for proving general properties of whole programming
    <i>languages</i>.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    For both of these, the first thing we need is a way of
    representing programs as mathematical objects, so we can talk
    about them precisely, plus ways of describing their behavior in
    terms of mathematical functions or relations.  Our main tools for
    these tasks are <i>abstract syntax</i> and <i>operational semantics</i>, a
    method of specifying programming languages by writing abstract
    interpreters.  At the beginning, we work with operational
    semantics in the so-called "big-step" style, which leads to simple
    and readable definitions when it is applicable.  Later on, we
    switch to a lower-level "small-step" style, which helps make some
    useful distinctions (e.g., between different sorts of
    nonterminating program behaviors) and which is applicable to a
    broader range of language features, including concurrency.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The first programming language we consider in detail is <i>Imp</i>, a
    tiny toy language capturing the core features of conventional
    imperative programming: variables, assignment, conditionals, and
    loops.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    We study two different ways of reasoning about the properties of
    Imp programs.  First, we consider what it means to say that two
    Imp programs are <i>equivalent</i> in the intuitive sense that they
    exhibit the same behavior when started in any initial memory
    state.  This notion of equivalence then becomes a criterion for
    judging the correctness of <i>metaprograms</i> &mdash; programs that
    manipulate other programs, such as compilers and optimizers.  We
    build a simple optimizer for Imp and prove that it is correct.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Second, we develop a methodology for proving that a given Imp
    program satisfies some formal specifications of its behavior.  We
    introduce the notion of <i>Hoare triples</i> &mdash; Imp programs annotated
    with pre- and post-conditions describing what they expect to be
    true about the memory in which they are started and what they
    promise to make true about the memory in which they terminate &mdash;
    and the reasoning principles of <i>Hoare Logic</i>, a domain-specific
    logic specialized for convenient compositional reasoning about
    imperative programs, with concepts like "loop invariant" built in.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    This part of the course is intended to give readers a taste of the
    key ideas and mathematical tools used in a wide variety of
    real-world software and hardware verification tasks. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab7"></a><h2 class="section">Type Systems</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Our final major topic, covering approximately the last third of
    the course, is <i>type systems</i>, which are powerful tools for
    establishing properties of <i>all</i> programs in a given language.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Type systems are the best established and most popular example of
    a highly successful class of formal verification techniques known
    as <i>lightweight formal methods</i>.  These are reasoning techniques
    of modest power &mdash; modest enough that automatic checkers can be
    built into compilers, linkers, or program analyzers and thus be
    applied even by programmers unfamiliar with the underlying
    theories.  Other examples of lightweight formal methods include
    hardware and software model checkers, contract checkers, and
    run-time monitoring techniques.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    This also completes a full circle with the beginning of the book:
    the language whose properties we study in this part, the <i>simply
    typed lambda-calculus</i>, is essentially a simplified model of the
    core of Coq itself!

<a name="lab11"></a><h2 class="section">System Requirements</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Coq runs on Windows, Linux, and OS X.  You will need:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> A current installation of Coq, available from the Coq home
         page.  Everything should work with version 8.4 (or 8.5).

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<li> An IDE for interacting with Coq.  Currently, there are two
         choices:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> Proof General is an Emacs-based IDE.  It tends to be
             preferred by users who are already comfortable with
             Emacs.  It requires a separate installation (google
             "Proof General").

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

             Adventurous users of Coq within Emacs may also want to
             check out extensions such as <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" type="var">company</span>-<span class="id" type="var">coq</span></span> and

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> CoqIDE is a simpler stand-alone IDE.  It is distributed
             with Coq, so it should be available once you have Coq
             installed.  It can also be compiled from scratch, but on
             some platforms this may involve installing additional
             packages for GUI libraries and such.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a name="lab12"></a><h2 class="section">Exercises</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Each chapter includes numerous exercises.  Each is marked with a
    "star rating," which can be interpreted as follows:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> One star: easy exercises that underscore points in the text
         and that, for most readers, should take only a minute or two.
         Get in the habit of working these as you reach them.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Two stars: straightforward exercises (five or ten minutes).

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Three stars: exercises requiring a bit of thought (ten
         minutes to half an hour).

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Four and five stars: more difficult exercises (half an hour
         and up).

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Also, some exercises are marked "advanced," and some are marked
    "optional."  Doing just the non-optional, non-advanced exercises
    should provide good coverage of the core material.  Optional
    exercises provide a bit of extra practice with key concepts and
    introduce secondary themes that may be of interest to some
    readers.  Advanced exercises are for readers who want an extra
    challenge and a deeper cut at the material.
