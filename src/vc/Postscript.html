<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 You've now seen how to verify programs that use many of C's data
  structures (arrays, pointers, structs, integers) and control
  structures (functions, if-then-else, loops), and abstraction 
  structures (data abstraction, module interfaces).  The final exercise
  (hash tables) demonstrated all of these at once, in addition to a
  key concept: layering the proof using a functional model,
  so that proofs about the properties of the functional model (<a href="Hashfun.html"><span class="inlineref">Hashfun</span></a>)
  cleanly separate from the implementation proof (<a href="Verif_hash.html"><span class="inlineref">Verif_hash</span></a>) showing
  that the C program refines the functional model.

<a id="lab156"></a><h2 class="section">Small examples</h2>
 VST is distributed with a <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">progs</span></span> directory of many small C programs
  that demonstrate different features and methods of Verifiable C.
  If your VST installation is in the standard place, you can find this
  as a subdirectory of <span class="inlinecode">`<span class="id" title="var">coqc</span></span> <span class="inlinecode">-<span class="id" title="keyword">where</span>`/<span class="id" title="var">user</span>-<span class="id" title="var">contrib</span>/<span class="id" title="var">VST</span></span>. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab157"></a><h2 class="section">Modules</h2>
 All the verifications in this volume are single-file C programs.  Real 
  software engineering in C is done with modules in .c files and interfaces
  in .h files.  Since 2019, VST has a module system; the early version
  is described in <a href="Bib.html#Beringer-2019"><span class="inlineref">[Beringer 2019]</span></a> and the newer version is demonstrated 
  in progs/VSUpile.  The description in <a href="Bib.html#Beringer-2019"><span class="inlineref">[Beringer 2019]</span></a> mostly matches
  the proofs in progs/VSUpile, but the proofs handle data abstraction in a more
  advanced way than is described in the paper. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab158"></a><h2 class="section">Input/output</h2>
  To prove I/O using our Verifiable C logic, we treat the state of the
  outside world as a resource in the SEP clause, alongside (but separating from) 
  in-memory conjuncts.  Proved examples are in <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">progs</span>/<span class="id" title="var">io.c</span>,</span> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">progs</span>/<span class="id" title="var">io_mem.c</span></span>,
  and their proof files <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">progs</span>/<span class="id" title="var">verif_io.v</span>,</span> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">progs</span>/<span class="id" title="var">verif_io_mem.v</span></span>.  Research

 VST is not the only program verification system.  How should you decide
  which system to use? 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab160"></a><h2 class="section">Static analyzers</h2>
 There are many <i>static analyzers</i> -- too numerous to list here -- that
  attempt to check <i>safety</i> of your program:  will it crash?  Will it access
  an array out of bounds, or dereference an uninitialized pointer?  Static
  analyzers can be useful in software engineering, but they have two major 
  limitations:
<ul class="doclist">
<li> They don't verify <i>functional correctness</i> -- that is, does your program
    produce the right answer, or interact with the right behavior?

</li>
<li> They are incomplete.  For example, proving that <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">a</span>[<span class="id" title="var">i</span>]</span> is an in-bounds array
    access requires proving that <span class="inlinecode">0</span> <span class="inlinecode">â‰¤</span> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">i</span></span> <span class="inlinecode">&lt;</span> <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">N</span></span>.  Sometimes a static analyzer
    can deduce that from the program flow, but in general it is a functional
    correctness property that may require sophisticated invariants to prove. 
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab161"></a><h2 class="section">Functional correctness verifiers -- functional languages</h2>
 A good way to write proved-correct software is to program in a pure
  functional program logic, and use higher-order logic to prove correctness.
  For example:
<ul class="doclist">
<li> Write pure functional programs in Coq, prove them correct in Coq, then
    extract them from Coq to OCaml or Haskell.  See Volume 3 of Software
    Foundations:  Verified Functional Algorithms.

</li>
<li> In HOL systems (Higher-order Logic) such as Isabelle/HOL, you can do the
    same thing: write functional programs, prove them correct, extract, compile.

</li>
<li> You can write Haskell programs, compile with <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">ghc</span></span>, and import into Coq
    for verification using hs-to-coq <a href="Bib.html#Spector-Zabusky-2018"><span class="inlineref">[Spector-Zabusky 2018]</span></a>.

</li>
<li> ACL2 is an older system, that uses a first-order logic.  That's less 
    expressive, you don't get polymorphism or quantification, but there
    have been many successful applications of ACL2 in industry. 
</li>
</ul>

<a id="lab162"></a><h2 class="section">Functional correctness verifiers -- imperative languages</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Functional programming has its limitations: it requires a garbage
  collector,  usually written in an imperative language, and how did you
  prove that correct?  In functional languages it is often harder
  to build (and reason about) low-latency code, or to access low-level
  primitives.  For these and other reasons, some software is still
  written in low-level imperative languages such as C.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

  There are verifiers for high-level imperative languages (that
  require a garbage collector).  For example, Dafny <a href="Bib.html#Leino-2010"><span class="inlineref">[Leino 2010]</span></a>
  is a language and tool for Hoare-logic style verification.
  It's relatively simple to learn and elegant to use.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

  ML with mutable references and arrays is also a high-level imperative
  language.  CFML is a system for reasoning about imperative ML
  programs using separation logic in Coq <a href="Bib.html#Chargueraud-2010"><span class="inlineref">[Chargueraud 2010]</span></a>,
  soon to be described in another volume of <i>Software Foundations</i>.
  CakeML is a system for proving (and correctly compiling) ML
  programs in HOL <a href="Bib.html#Kumar-2014"><span class="inlineref">[Kumar 2014]</span></a>. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab163"></a><h2 class="section">Functional correctness verifiers -- C</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 For the canonical <i>low-level imperative language</i> -- C -- there
  are several systems:
<ul class="doclist">
<li> Frama-C (<a href="https://frama-c.com/"><span class="inlineref">https://frama-c.com/</span></a>)

</li>
<li> VeriFast <a href="Bib.html#Jacobs-2011"><span class="inlineref">[Jacobs 2011]</span></a>

</li>
<li> VST (the subject of this volume).

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

  Unlike VST, where (as you have seen) the proof script is separate from
  the program, in both Frama-C and VeriFast you prove the program by inserting
  assertions and invariants into the program. the tools complete the
  verification automatically -- or else, point out which assertions 
  have failed, so you can adjust your assertions and invariants, and try again.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

  Each of these three systems has an assertion language, in which you
  express your function specifications, assertions, and invariants.
<ul class="doclist">
<li> In VST, as you have seen, that language is a separation language
    (PROP/LOCAL/SEP) embedded in Coq, so that the PROP, LOCAL, and SEP
    clauses can all make use of the full expressive power of the Calculus
    of Inductive Constructions (CiC).  You have seen a simple example of
    the expressive power of this approach, where we can use ordinary Coq 
    proofs in <a href="Hashfun.html"><span class="inlineref">Hashfun</span></a>, and directly connect them to separation-logic
    proofs in <a href="Verif_hash.html"><span class="inlineref">Verif_hash</span></a>.

</li>
<li> Frama-C uses a weaker assertion language, expressed in C syntax.  That's
    a much weaker logic to reason in, and it doesn't directly connect to
    a general-purpose logic (and proof assistant) like Coq.  Also, since
    Frama-C is not a separation logic, it can be difficult to reason about
    data structures.

</li>
<li> VeriFast uses a capable Dafny-like logic -- even more capable, since
    it is separation logic, not just Hoare logic.  That means you can reason
    about data structures.  There's no artificial limitation to a C-like syntax
    in the assertion language.  Unfortunately, VeriFast's assertion language
    is not connected to a general-purpose logic (and proof assistant); that 
    means you can do refinement proofs (this C program implements that
    functional model),  but it's not so easy to reason about properties of
    your functional models. 
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab164"></a><h2 class="section">Foundational soundness</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Formal reasoning about source programs is a good thing -- but once you've
  proved your source program correct, how do you know that is compiled
  correctly?  That is, 
<ul class="doclist">
<li> the compiler must not have bugs, and

</li>
<li> the compiler must agree with your verifier on every detail of the
    semantics of the source language.

</li>
</ul>
  Of all the systems described above, only VST and CakeML can make this
  connection end-to-end, with machine-checked proofs. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab165"></a><h1 class="section">Conclusion</h1>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 This volume has given you a taste of formal verification for a low-level
  imperative language.  Since C was not designed with verification in mind,
  it has many sharp corners and idiosyncrasies, which the verification tool
  cannot always hide from you.  But C is a <i>lingua franca</i> in which you can
  express a wide variety of programming paradigms, and Verifiable C is
  expressive enough to allow to verify them.  We wish you success in your
  future software verification efforts.
