<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Here's a good way to build formally verified correct software:
<ul class="doclist">
<li> Write your program in an expressive language with a good proof theory
      (the Gallina language embedded in Coq's logic).

</li>
<li> Prove it correct in Coq.

</li>
<li> Extract it to ML and compile it with an optimizing ML compiler.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Unfortunately, for some applications you cannot afford to use a higher-order
 garbage-collected functional programming language such as Gallina or ML.
 Perhaps you are writing an operating-system kernel, or a bit-shuffling
 cryptographic primitive, or the runtime system and garbage-collector of
 your functional language!  In those cases, you might want to use a low-level
 imperative systems programming language such as C.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 But you still want your OS, or crypto, or GC, to be correct!   So you should
 use machine-checked program verification in Coq.  For that purpose, you can
 use <i>Verifiable C</i>, a program logic and proof system for C.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 What is a program logic?  One example of a program logic is the Hoare
 logic that you studied in the <i>Programming Language Foundations</i>
 volume of this series.  (If you have not done so already, study the
 Hoare and Hoare2 chapters of that volume, and do the exercises.)

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Verifiable C is based on a 21st-century version of Hoare logic called
 <i>higher-order impredicative concurrent separation logic</i>.  Back in
 the 20th century, computer scientists discovered that Hoare Logic was
 not very good at verifying programs with pointer data structures; so
 <i>separation logic</i> was developed.  Hoare Logic was clumsy at
 verifying concurrent programs, so <i>concurrent separation logic</i> was
 developed.  Hoare Logic could not handle higher-order object-oriented
 programming patterns or function-closures, so <i>higher-order
 impredicative program logics</i> were developed.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 This electronic book is Volume 5 of the <i>Software Foundations</i> series,
 which presents the mathematical underpinnings of reliable software.  The
 principal novelty of <i>Software Foundations</i> is that it is one hundred
 percent formalized and machine-checked: the entire text is literally a
 script for Coq.  It is intended to be read alongside an interactive
 session with Coq.  All the details in the text are fully formalized in Coq,
 and the exercises are designed to be worked using Coq.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Before studying this volume, you should be a competent user of Coq:
<ul class="doclist">
<li> Study  <i>Software Foundations Volume 1</i>  (Logical Foundations), and
   do the exercises!

</li>
<li> Study the Hoare and Hoare2 chapters of
   <i>Software Foundations Volume 2</i>  (Programming Language Foundations), and
   do the exercises!

</li>
<li> Study the Sort, SearchTree, and ADT chapters of
   <i>Software Foundations Volume 3</i>  (Verified Functional Algorithms), and
   do the exercises!

</li>
</ul>
 You will also need a working knowledge of the C programming language.

<a id="lab3"></a><h2 class="section">System Requirements</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Coq runs on Windows, Linux, and OS X.  The Preface of Volume 1
   describes the Coq installation you will need.  This edition was
   built with Coq 8.12.0.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

   You will need VST installed.  You can do that either by installing
   it as part of the standard "Coq Platform" that is released with each
   new version of Coq, or using opam (the package is named coq-vst).
   At the end of this chapter is a test to make sure you have the right
   version of VST installed.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

   <i>IF YOU USE OPAM</i>, the following opam commands may be useful:
<ul class="doclist">
<li> opam repo add coq-released

</li>
<li> opam pin coq 8.12.0

</li>
<li> opam install coq-vst.2.6 (<i>this will take 30 minutes or more</i>)

</li>
<li> (to use coqide:) opam pin lablgtk3 3.0.beta5

</li>
<li> (to use coqide:) opam install coqide

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

   <i>You do not need to install CompCert clightgen</i> to do the exercises
   in this volume.  But if you wish to modify and reparse the .c files,
   or verify C programs of your own, install the CompCert verified
   optimizing C compiler.  You can get CompCert from compcert.inria.fr,
   or (starting with Coq 8.12) in the standard "Coq Package" or by
   opam (the package is named coq-compcert). 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab4"></a><h2 class="section">Downloading the Coq Files</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 A tar file containing the full sources for the "release version"
    of this book (as a collection of Coq scripts and HTML files) is
    available at <a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu"><span class="inlineref">https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu</span></a>.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    (If you are using the book as part of a class, your professor may
    give you access to a locally modified version of the files, which
    you should use instead of the release version.) 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab5"></a><h2 class="section">Installation</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Unpack the <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">vc.tgz</span></span> tar file into a vc directory.
    In this <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">vc</span></span> directory, the <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">make</span></span> command builds it. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab6"></a><h2 class="section">Exercises</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Each chapter includes exercises.  Each is marked with a
    "star rating," which can be interpreted as follows:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> One star: easy exercises that underscore points in the text
         and that, for most readers, should take only a minute or two.
         Get in the habit of working these as you reach them.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Two stars: straightforward exercises (five or ten minutes).

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Three stars: exercises requiring a bit of thought (ten
         minutes to half an hour).

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Four and five stars: more difficult exercises (half an hour
         and up).

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

   <font color="red"> <i>Please do not post solutions to the exercises in any public place</i>: </font>
    Software Foundations is widely used both for self-study and for
    university courses.  Having solutions easily available makes it
    much less useful for courses, which typically have graded homework
    assignments.  The authors especially request that readers not post
    solutions to the exercises anyplace where they can be found by
    search engines.
