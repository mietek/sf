(** We have seen that Coq has mechanisms both for _programming_,
    using inductive data types like [nat] or [list] and functions over
    these types, and for _proving_ properties of these programs, using
    inductive propositions (like [ev]), implication, universal
    quantification, and the like.  So far, we have mostly treated
    these mechanisms as if they were quite separate, and for many
    purposes this is a good way to think.  But we have also seen hints
    that Coq's programming and proving facilities are closely related.
    For example, the keyword [Inductive] is used to declare both data
    types and propositions, and [->] is used both to describe the type
    of functions on data and logical implication.  This is not just a
    syntactic accident!  In fact, programs and proofs in Coq are
    almost the same thing.  In this chapter we will study how this
    works.

    We have already seen the fundamental idea: provability in Coq is
    represented by concrete _evidence_.  When we construct the proof
    of a basic proposition, we are actually building a tree of
    evidence, which can be thought of as a data structure.

    If the proposition is an implication like [A -> B], then its proof
    will be an evidence _transformer_: a recipe for converting
    evidence for A into evidence for B.  So at a fundamental level,
    proofs are simply programs that manipulate evidence. *)

(** Question: If evidence is data, what are propositions themselves?

    Answer: They are types!

    Look again at the formal definition of the [ev] property.  *)

Print ev.
(* ==>
  Inductive ev : nat -> Prop :=
    | ev_0 : ev 0
    | ev_SS : forall n, ev n -> ev (S (S n)).
*)

(** Suppose we introduce an alternative pronunciation of "[:]".
    Instead of "has type," we can say "is a proof of."  For example,
    the second line in the definition of [ev] declares that [ev_0 : ev
    0].  Instead of "[ev_0] has type [ev 0]," we can say that "[ev_0]
    is a proof of [ev 0]." *)

(** This pun between types and propositions -- between [:] as "has type"
    and [:] as "is a proof of" or "is evidence for" -- is called the
    _Curry-Howard correspondence_.  It proposes a deep connection
    between the world of logic and the world of computation:

                 propositions  ~  types
                 proofs        ~  data values

    See [Wadler 2015] for a brief history and an up-to-date exposition.

    Many useful insights follow from this connection.  To begin with,
    it gives us a natural interpretation of the type of the [ev_SS]
    constructor: *)

Check ev_SS.
(* ===> ev_SS : forall n,
                  ev n ->
                  ev (S (S n)) *)

(** This can be read "[ev_SS] is a constructor that takes two
    arguments -- a number [n] and evidence for the proposition [ev
    n] -- and yields evidence for the proposition [ev (S (S n))]." *)

(** Now let's look again at a previous proof involving [ev]. *)

Theorem ev_4 : ev 4.
Proof.
  apply ev_SS. apply ev_SS. apply ev_0. Qed.

(** As with ordinary data values and functions, we can use the [Print]
    command to see the _proof object_ that results from this proof
    script. *)

Print ev_4.
(* ===> ev_4 = ev_SS 2 (ev_SS 0 ev_0)
     : ev 4  *)

(** As a matter of fact, we can also write down this proof object
    _directly_, without the need for a separate proof script: *)

Check (ev_SS 2 (ev_SS 0 ev_0)).
(* ===> ev 4 *)

(** The expression [ev_SS 2 (ev_SS 0 ev_0)] can be thought of as
    instantiating the parameterized constructor [ev_SS] with the
    specific arguments [2] and [0] plus the corresponding proof
    objects for its premises [ev 2] and [ev 0].  Alternatively, we can
    think of [ev_SS] as a primitive "evidence constructor" that, when
    applied to a particular number, wants to be further applied to
    evidence that that number is even; its type,

      forall n, ev n -> ev (S (S n)),

    expresses this functionality, in the same way that the polymorphic
    type [forall X, list X] expresses the fact that the constructor
    [nil] can be thought of as a function from types to empty lists
    with elements of that type. *)

(** You may recall (as seen in the [Logic] chapter) that we can
    use function application syntax to instantiate universally
    quantified variables in lemmas, as well as to supply evidence for
    assumptions that these lemmas impose. For instance: *)

Theorem ev_4': ev 4.
Proof.
  apply (ev_SS 2 (ev_SS 0 ev_0)).
Qed.

(** We can now see that this feature is a trivial consequence of the
    status the Coq grants to proofs and propositions: Lemmas and
    hypotheses can be combined in expressions (i.e., proof objects)
    according to the same basic rules used for programs in the
    language. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Proof Scripts *)

(** The _proof objects_ we've been discussing lie at the core of how
    Coq operates.  When Coq is following a proof script, what is
    happening internally is that it is gradually constructing a proof
    object -- a term whose type is the proposition being proved.  The
    tactics between [Proof] and [Qed] tell it how to build up a term
    of the required type.  To see this process in action, let's use
    the [Show Proof] command to display the current state of the proof
    tree at various points in the following tactic proof. *)

Theorem ev_4'' : ev 4.
Proof.
  Show Proof.
  apply ev_SS.
  Show Proof.
  apply ev_SS.
  Show Proof.
  apply ev_0.
  Show Proof.
Qed.

(** At any given moment, Coq has constructed a term with some
    "holes" (indicated by [?1], [?2], and so on), and it knows what
    type of evidence is needed at each hole.  *)

(** Each of the holes corresponds to a subgoal, and the proof is
    finished when there are no more subgoals.  At this point, the
    evidence we've built stored in the global context under the name
    given in the [Theorem] command. *)

(** Tactic proofs are useful and convenient, but they are not
    essential: in principle, we can always construct the required
    evidence by hand, as shown above. Then we can use [Definition]
    (rather than [Theorem]) to give a global name directly to a
    piece of evidence. *)

Definition ev_4''' : ev 4 :=
  ev_SS 2 (ev_SS 0 ev_0).

(** All these different ways of building the proof lead to exactly the
    same evidence being saved in the global environment. *)

(** * Quantifiers, Implications, Functions *)

(** In Coq's computational universe (where data structures and
    programs live), there are two sorts of values with arrows in their
    types: _constructors_ introduced by [Inductive]-ly defined data
    types, and _functions_.

    Similarly, in Coq's logical universe (where we carry out proofs),
    there are two ways of giving evidence for an implication:
    constructors introduced by [Inductive]-ly defined propositions,
    and... functions!

    For example, consider this statement: *)

Theorem ev_plus4 : forall n, ev n -> ev (4 + n).
Proof.
  intros n H. simpl.
  apply ev_SS.
  apply ev_SS.
  apply H.
Qed.

(** What is the proof object corresponding to [ev_plus4]?

    We're looking for an expression whose _type_ is [forall n, ev n ->
    ev (4 + n)] -- that is, a _function_ that takes two arguments (one
    number and a piece of evidence) and returns a piece of evidence!
    Here it is: *)

Definition ev_plus4' : forall n, ev n -> ev (4 + n) :=
  fun (n : nat) => fun (H : ev n) =>
    ev_SS (S (S n)) (ev_SS n H).

Check ev_plus4'.
(* ===> ev_plus4' : forall n : nat, ev n -> ev (4 + n) *)

(** Recall that [fun n => blah] means "the function that, given [n],
    yields [blah]," and that Coq treats [4 + n] and [S (S (S (S n)))]
    as synonyms. Another equivalent way to write this definition is: *)

Definition ev_plus4'' (n : nat) (H : ev n) : ev (4 + n) :=
  ev_SS (S (S n)) (ev_SS n H).

Check ev_plus4''.
(* ===> ev_plus4'' : forall n : nat, ev n -> ev (4 + n) *)

(** When we view the proposition being proved by [ev_plus4] as a
    function type, one aspect of it may seem a little unusual. The
    second argument's type, [ev n], mentions the _value_ of the first
    argument, [n].  While such _dependent types_ are not found in
    conventional programming languages, they can be useful in
    programming too, as recent work in the functional programming
    community demonstrates.

    Notice that both implication ([->]) and quantification ([forall])
    correspond to functions on evidence.  In fact, they are really the
    same thing: [->] is just a shorthand for a degenerate use of
    [forall] where there is no dependency, i.e., no need to give a
    name to the type on the LHS of the arrow. *)

(** For example, consider this proposition: *)

Definition ev_plus2 : Prop :=
  forall n, forall (E : ev n), ev (n + 2).

(** A proof term inhabiting this proposition would be a function
    with two arguments: a number [n] and some evidence [E] that [n] is
    even.  But the name [E] for this evidence is not used in the rest
    of the statement of [ev_plus2], so it's a bit silly to bother
    making up a name for it.  We could write it like this instead,
    using the dummy identifier [_] in place of a real name: *)

Definition ev_plus2' : Prop :=
  forall n, forall (_ : ev n), ev (n + 2).

(** Or, equivalently, we can write it in more familiar notation: *)

Definition ev_plus2'' : Prop :=
  forall n, ev n -> ev (n + 2).

(** In general, "[P -> Q]" is just syntactic sugar for
    "[forall (_:P), Q]". *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Connectives as Inductive Types *)

(** Inductive definitions are powerful enough to express most of the
    connectives and quantifiers we have seen so far.  Indeed, only
    universal quantification (and thus implication) is built into Coq;
    all the others are defined inductively.  We study these
    definitions in this section. *)

Module Props.

(** ** Conjunction

    To prove that [P /\ Q] holds, we must present evidence for both
    [P] and [Q].  Thus, it makes sense to define a proof object for [P
    /\ Q] as consisting of a pair of two proofs: one for [P] and
    another one for [Q]. This leads to the following definition. *)

Module And.

Inductive and (P Q : Prop) : Prop :=
| conj : P -> Q -> and P Q.

End And.

(** Notice the similarity with the definition of the [prod] type,
    given in chapter [Poly]; the only difference is that [prod] takes
    [Type] arguments, whereas [and] takes [Prop] arguments. *)

Print prod.
(* ===>
   Inductive prod (X Y : Type) : Type :=
   | pair : X -> Y -> X * Y. *)

(** This should clarify why [destruct] and [intros] patterns can be
    used on a conjunctive hypothesis.  Case analysis allows us to
    consider all possible ways in which [P /\ Q] was proved -- here
    just one (the [conj] constructor).  Similarly, the [split] tactic
    actually works for any inductively defined proposition with only
    one constructor.  In particular, it works for [and]: *)

Lemma and_comm : forall P Q : Prop, P /\ Q <-> Q /\ P.
Proof.
  intros P Q. split.
  - intros [HP HQ]. split.
    + apply HQ.
    + apply HP.
  - intros [HP HQ]. split.
    + apply HQ.
    + apply HP.
Qed.

(** This shows why the inductive definition of [and] can be
    manipulated by tactics as we've been doing.  We can also use it to
    build proofs directly, using pattern-matching.  For instance: *)

Definition and_comm'_aux P Q (H : P /\ Q) :=
  match H with
  | conj HP HQ => conj HQ HP
  end.

Definition and_comm' P Q : P /\ Q <-> Q /\ P :=
  conj (and_comm'_aux P Q) (and_comm'_aux Q P).

(** Construct a proof object demonstrating the following proposition. *)

Definition conj_fact : forall P Q R, P /\ Q -> Q /\ R -> P /\ R 
  (* REPLACE THIS LINE WITH   := _your_definition_ . *). Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** ** Disjunction

    The inductive definition of disjunction uses two constructors, one
    for each side of the disjunct: *)

Module Or.

Inductive or (P Q : Prop) : Prop :=
| or_introl : P -> or P Q
| or_intror : Q -> or P Q.

End Or.

(** This declaration explains the behavior of the [destruct] tactic on
    a disjunctive hypothesis, since the generated subgoals match the
    shape of the [or_introl] and [or_intror] constructors.

    Once again, we can also directly write proof objects for theorems
    involving [or], without resorting to tactics. *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, optional (or_commut'')  *)
(** Try to write down an explicit proof object for [or_commut] (without
    using [Print] to peek at the ones we already defined!). *)

Definition or_comm : forall P Q, P \/ Q -> Q \/ P 
  (* REPLACE THIS LINE WITH   := _your_definition_ . *). Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** ** Existential Quantification

    To give evidence for an existential quantifier, we package a
    witness [x] together with a proof that [x] satisfies the property
    [P]: *)

Module Ex.

Inductive ex {A : Type} (P : A -> Prop) : Prop :=
| ex_intro : forall x : A, P x -> ex P.

End Ex.

(** This may benefit from a little unpacking.  The core definition is
    for a type former [ex] that can be used to build propositions of
    the form [ex P], where [P] itself is a _function_ from witness
    values in the type [A] to propositions.  The [ex_intro]
    constructor then offers a way of constructing evidence for [ex P],
    given a witness [x] and a proof of [P x].

    The more familiar form [exists x, P x] desugars to an expression
    involving [ex]: *)

Check ex (fun n => ev n).
(* ===> exists n : nat, ev n
        : Prop *)

(** Here's how to define an explicit proof object involving [ex]: *)

Definition some_nat_is_even : exists n, ev n :=
  ex_intro ev 4 (ev_SS 2 (ev_SS 0 ev_0)).

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, optional (ex_ev_Sn)  *)
(** Complete the definition of the following proof object: *)

Definition ex_ev_Sn : ex (fun n => ev (S n)) 
  (* REPLACE THIS LINE WITH   := _your_definition_ . *). Admitted.
(** [] *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** [True] and [False] *)

(** The inductive definition of the [True] proposition is simple: *)

Inductive True : Prop :=
  I : True.

(** It has one constructor (so every proof of [True] is the same, so
    being given a proof of [True] is not informative.) *)

(** [False] is equally simple -- indeed, so simple it may look
    syntactically wrong at first glance! *)

Inductive False : Prop :=.

(** That is, [False] is an inductive type with _no_ constructors --
    i.e., no way to build evidence for it. *)

End Props.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Programming with Tactics *)

(** If we can build proofs by giving explicit terms rather than
    executing tactic scripts, you may be wondering whether we can
    build _programs_ using _tactics_ rather than explicit terms.
    Naturally, the answer is yes! *)

Definition add1 : nat -> nat.
intro n.
Show Proof.
apply S.
Show Proof.
apply n. Defined.

Print add1.
(* ==>
    add1 = fun n : nat => S n
         : nat -> nat
*)

Compute add1 2.
(* ==> 3 : nat *)

(** Notice that we terminate the [Definition] with a [.] rather than
    with [:=] followed by a term.  This tells Coq to enter _proof
    scripting mode_ to build an object of type [nat -> nat].  Also, we
    terminate the proof with [Defined] rather than [Qed]; this makes
    the definition _transparent_ so that it can be used in computation
    like a normally-defined function.  ([Qed]-defined objects are
    opaque during computation.)

    This feature is mainly useful for writing functions with dependent
    types, which we won't explore much further in this book.  But it
    does illustrate the uniformity and orthogonality of the basic
    ideas in Coq. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Equality *)

(** Even Coq's equality relation is not built in.  It has the
    following inductive definition.  (Actually, the definition in the
    standard library is a small variant of this, which gives an
    induction principle that is slightly easier to use.) *)

Module MyEquality.

Inductive eq {X:Type} : X -> X -> Prop :=
| eq_refl : forall x, eq x x.

Notation "x = y" := (eq x y)
                    (at level 70, no associativity)
                    : type_scope.

(** The way to think about this definition is that, given a set [X],
    it defines a _family_ of propositions "[x] is equal to [y],"
    indexed by pairs of values ([x] and [y]) from [X].  There is just
    one way of constructing evidence for each member of this family:
    applying the constructor [eq_refl] to a type [X] and a value [x :
    X] yields evidence that [x] is equal to [x]. *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars (leibniz_equality)  *)
(** The inductive definition of equality corresponds to _Leibniz
    equality_: what we mean when we say "[x] and [y] are equal" is
    that every property on [P] that is true of [x] is also true of
    [y].  *)

Lemma leibniz_equality : forall (X : Type) (x y: X),
  x = y -> forall P:X->Prop, P x -> P y.
Proof.
(* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** We can use [eq_refl] to construct evidence that, for example, [2 =
    2].  Can we also use it to construct evidence that [1 + 1 = 2]?
    Yes, we can.  Indeed, it is the very same piece of evidence!  The
    reason is that Coq treats as "the same" any two terms that are
    _convertible_ according to a simple set of computation rules.
    These rules, which are similar to those used by [Compute], include
    evaluation of function application, inlining of definitions, and
    simplification of [match]es.  *)

Lemma four: 2 + 2 = 1 + 3.
Proof.
  apply eq_refl.
Qed.

(** The [reflexivity] tactic that we have used to prove equalities up
    to now is essentially just short-hand for [apply refl_equal].

    In tactic-based proofs of equality, the conversion rules are
    normally hidden in uses of [simpl] (either explicit or implicit in
    other tactics such as [reflexivity]).  But you can see them
    directly at work in the following explicit proof objects: *)

Definition four' : 2 + 2 = 1 + 3 :=
  eq_refl 4.

Definition singleton : forall (X:Set) (x:X), []++[x] = x::[]  :=
  fun (X:Set) (x:X) => eq_refl [x].


End MyEquality.

Definition quiz6 : exists x,  x + 3 = 4
  := ex_intro (fun z => (z + 3 = 4)) 1 (refl_equal 4).

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Inversion, Again *)

(** We've seen [inversion] used with both equality hypotheses and
    hypotheses about inductively defined propositions.  Now that we've
    seen that these are actually the same thing, we're in a position
    to take a closer look at how [inversion] behaves.

    In general, the [inversion] tactic...

    - takes a hypothesis [H] whose type [P] is inductively defined,
      and

    - for each constructor [C] in [P]'s definition,

      - generates a new subgoal in which we assume [H] was
        built with [C],

      - adds the arguments (premises) of [C] to the context of
        the subgoal as extra hypotheses,

      - matches the conclusion (result type) of [C] against the
        current goal and calculates a set of equalities that must
        hold in order for [C] to be applicable,

      - adds these equalities to the context (and, for convenience,
        rewrites them in the goal), and

      - if the equalities are not satisfiable (e.g., they involve
        things like [S n = O]), immediately solves the subgoal. *)

(** _Example_: If we invert a hypothesis built with [or], there are two
   constructors, so two subgoals get generated.  The
   conclusion (result type) of the constructor ([P \/ Q]) doesn't
   place any restrictions on the form of [P] or [Q], so we don't get
   any extra equalities in the context of the subgoal.

   _Example_: If we invert a hypothesis built with [and], there is
   only one constructor, so only one subgoal gets generated.  Again,
   the conclusion (result type) of the constructor ([P /\ Q]) doesn't
   place any restrictions on the form of [P] or [Q], so we don't get
   any extra equalities in the context of the subgoal.  The
   constructor does have two arguments, though, and these can be seen
   in the context in the subgoal.

   _Example_: If we invert a hypothesis built with [eq], there is
   again only one constructor, so only one subgoal gets generated.
   Now, though, the form of the [refl_equal] constructor does give us
   some extra information: it tells us that the two arguments to [eq]
   must be the same!  The [inversion] tactic adds this fact to the
   context. *)
