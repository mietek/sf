(** In the past couple of chapters, we've begun applying the
    mathematical tools developed in the first part of the course to
    studying the theory of a small programming language, Imp.

    - We defined a type of _abstract syntax trees_ for Imp, together
      with an _evaluation relation_ (a partial function on states)
      that specifies the _operational semantics_ of programs.

      The language we defined, though small, captures some of the key
      features of full-blown languages like C, C++, and Java,
      including the fundamental notion of mutable state and some
      common control structures.

    - We proved a number of _metatheoretic properties_ -- "meta" in
      the sense that they are properties of the language as a whole,
      rather than of particular programs in the language.  These
      included:

        - determinism of evaluation

        - equivalence of some different ways of writing down the
          definitions (e.g., functional and relational definitions of
          arithmetic expression evaluation)

        - guaranteed termination of certain classes of programs

        - correctness (in the sense of preserving meaning) of a number
          of useful program transformations

        - behavioral equivalence of programs (in the [Equiv] chapter). 

    If we stopped here, we would already have something useful: a set
    of tools for defining and discussing programming languages and
    language features that are mathematically precise, flexible, and
    easy to work with, applied to a set of key properties.  All of
    these properties are things that language designers, compiler
    writers, and users might care about knowing.  Indeed, many of them
    are so fundamental to our understanding of the programming
    languages we deal with that we might not consciously recognize
    them as "theorems."  But properties that seem intuitively obvious
    can sometimes be quite subtle (sometimes also subtly wrong!).

    We'll return to the theme of metatheoretic properties of whole
    languages later in the book when we discuss _types_ and _type
    soundness_.  In this chapter, though, we turn to a different set
    of issues.

    Our goal is to carry out some simple examples of _program
    verification_ -- i.e., to use the precise definition of Imp to
    prove formally that particular programs satisfy particular
    specifications of their behavior.  We'll develop a reasoning
    system called _Floyd-Hoare Logic_ -- often shortened to just
    _Hoare Logic_ -- in which each of the syntactic constructs of Imp
    is equipped with a generic "proof rule" that can be used to reason
    compositionally about the correctness of programs involving this
    construct.

    Hoare Logic originated in the 1960s, and it continues to be the
    subject of intensive research right up to the present day.  It
    lies at the core of a multitude of tools that are being used in
    academia and industry to specify and verify real software
    systems. 

    Hoare Logic combines two beautiful ideas: a natural way of
    writing down _specifications_ of programs, and a _compositional
    proof technique_ for proving that programs are correct with
    respect to such specifications -- where by "compositional" we mean
    that the structure of proofs directly mirrors the structure of the
    programs that they are about. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Assertions *)

(** To talk about specifications of programs, the first thing we
    need is a way of making _assertions_ about properties that hold at
    particular points during a program's execution -- i.e., claims
    about the current state of the memory when execution reaches that
    point.  Formally, an assertion is just a family of propositions
    indexed by a [state]. *)

(** [] *)

(** This way of writing assertions can be a little bit heavy,
    for two reasons: (1) every single assertion that we ever write is
    going to begin with [fun st => ]; and (2) this state [st] is the
    only one that we ever use to look up variables in assertions (we
    will never need to talk about two different memory states at the
    same time).  For discussing examples informally, we'll adopt some
    simplifying conventions: we'll drop the initial [fun st =>], and
    we'll write just [X] to mean [st X].  Thus, instead of writing *)

      fun st => (st Z) * (st Z) <= m /\
                ~ ((S (st Z)) * (S (st Z)) <= m)

    we'll write just

      Z * Z <= m /\ ~((S Z) * (S Z) <= m).
*)

(** Given two assertions [P] and [Q], we say that [P] _implies_ [Q],
    written [P ->> Q] (in ASCII, [P -][>][> Q]), if, whenever [P]
    holds in some state [st], [Q] also holds. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Hoare Triples *)

(** Next, we need a way of making formal claims about the
    behavior of commands. *)

(** In general, the behavior of a command is to transform one state to
    another, so it is natural to express claims about commands in
    terms of assertions that are true before and after the command
    executes:

      - "If command [c] is started in a state satisfying assertion
        [P], and if [c] eventually terminates in some final state,
        then this final state will satisfy the assertion [Q]."

    Such a claim is called a _Hoare Triple_.  The property [P] is
    called the _precondition_ of [c], while [Q] is the
    _postcondition_.  Formally: *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Proof Rules *)

(** The goal of Hoare logic is to provide a _compositional_
    method for proving the validity of specific Hoare triples.  That
    is, we want the structure of a program's correctness proof to
    mirror the structure of the program itself.  To this end, in the
    sections below, we'll introduce a rule for reasoning about each of
    the different syntactic forms of commands in Imp -- one for
    assignment, one for sequencing, one for conditionals, etc. -- plus
    a couple of "structural" rules for gluing things together.  We
    will then be able to prove programs correct using these proof
    rules, without ever unfolding the definition of [hoare_triple]. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Assignment *)

(** The rule for assignment is the most fundamental of the Hoare logic
    proof rules.  Here's how it works.

    Consider this valid Hoare triple:

       {{ Y = 1 }}  X ::= Y  {{ X = 1 }}

    In English: if we start out in a state where the value of [Y]
    is [1] and we assign [Y] to [X], then we'll finish in a
    state where [X] is [1].  That is, the property of being equal
    to [1] gets transferred from [Y] to [X].

    Similarly, in

       {{ Y + Z = 1 }}  X ::= Y + Z  {{ X = 1 }}

    the same property (being equal to one) gets transferred to
    [X] from the expression [Y + Z] on the right-hand side of
    the assignment.

    More generally, if [a] is _any_ arithmetic expression, then

       {{ a = 1 }}  X ::= a {{ X = 1 }}

    is a valid Hoare triple.

    This can be made even more general. To conclude that an
    arbitrary property [Q] holds after [X ::= a], we need to assume
    that [Q] holds before [X ::= a], but _with all occurrences of_ [X]
    replaced by [a] in [Q]. This leads to the Hoare rule for
    assignment

      {{ Q [X |-> a] }} X ::= a {{ Q }}

    where "[Q [X |-> a]]" is pronounced "[Q] where [a] is substituted
    for [X]".

    For example, these are valid applications of the assignment
    rule:

      {{ (X <= 5) [X |-> X + 1]
         i.e., X + 1 <= 5 }}
      X ::= X + 1
      {{ X <= 5 }}

      {{ (X = 3) [X |-> 3]
         i.e., 3 = 3}}
      X ::= 3
      {{ X = 3 }}

      {{ (0 <= X /\ X <= 5) [X |-> 3]
         i.e., (0 <= 3 /\ 3 <= 5)}}
      X ::= 3
      {{ 0 <= X /\ X <= 5 }}
*)

(** To formalize the rule, we must first formalize the idea of
    "substituting an expression for an Imp variable in an assertion."
    That is, given a proposition [P], a variable [X], and an
    arithmetic expression [a], we want to derive another proposition
    [P'] that is just the same as [P] except that, wherever [P]
    mentions [X], [P'] should instead mention [a].

    Since [P] is an arbitrary Coq proposition, we can't directly
    "edit" its text.  Instead, we can achieve the effect we want by
    evaluating [P] in an updated state: *)

Definition assn_sub X a P : Assertion :=
  fun (st : state) =>
    P (t_update st X (aeval st a)).

Notation "P [ X |-> a ]" := (assn_sub X a P) (at level 10).

(** That is, [P [X |-> a]] is an assertion -- let's call it [P'] -- 
    that is just like [P] except that, wherever [P] looks up the 
    variable [X] in the current state, [P'] instead uses the value 
    of the expression [a].

    To see how this works, let's calculate what happens with a couple
    of examples.  First, suppose [P'] is [(X <= 5) [X |-> 3]] -- that
    is, more formally, [P'] is the Coq expression

    fun st =>
      (fun st' => st' X <= 5)
      (t_update st X (aeval st (ANum 3))),

    which simplifies to

    fun st =>
      (fun st' => st' X <= 5)
      (t_update st X 3)

    and further simplifies to

    fun st =>
      ((t_update st X 3) X) <= 5)

    and by further simplification to

    fun st =>
      (3 <= 5).

    That is, [P'] is the assertion that [3] is less than or equal to
    [5] (as expected).

    For a more interesting example, suppose [P'] is [(X <= 5) [X |->
    X+1]].  Formally, [P'] is the Coq expression

    fun st =>
      (fun st' => st' X <= 5)
      (t_update st X (aeval st (APlus (AId X) (ANum 1)))),

    which simplifies to

    fun st =>
      (((t_update st X (aeval st (APlus (AId X) (ANum 1))))) X) <= 5

    and further simplifies to

    fun st =>
      (aeval st (APlus (AId X) (ANum 1))) <= 5.

    That is, [P'] is the assertion that [X+1] is at most [5].
*)

(** Now we can give the precise proof rule for assignment:

      ------------------------------ (hoare_asgn)
      {{Q [X |-> a]}} X ::= a {{Q}}
*)

(** We can prove formally that this rule is indeed valid. *)

Theorem hoare_asgn : forall Q X a,
  {{Q [X |-> a]}} (X ::= a) {{Q}}.
Proof.
  unfold hoare_triple.
  intros Q X a st st' HE HQ.
  inversion HE. subst.
  unfold assn_sub in HQ. assumption.  Qed.

(** Here's a first formal proof using this rule. *)

Example assn_sub_example :
  {{(fun st => st X = 3) [X |-> ANum 3]}}
  (X ::= (ANum 3))
  {{fun st => st X = 3}}.
Proof.

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars (hoare_asgn_wrong)  *)
(** The assignment rule looks backward to almost everyone the first
    time they see it.  If it still seems puzzling, it may help
    to think a little about alternative "forward" rules.  Here is a
    seemingly natural one:

      ------------------------------ (hoare_asgn_wrong)
      {{ True }} X ::= a {{ X = a }}

    Give a counterexample showing that this rule is incorrect and 
    argue informally that it is really a counterexample.  (Hint: 
    The rule universally quantifies over the arithmetic expression 
    [a], and your counterexample needs to exhibit an [a] for which 
    the rule doesn't work.) *)

(* FILL IN HERE *)
(** [] *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, advanced (hoare_asgn_fwd)  *)
(** However, by using an auxiliary variable [m] to remember the 
    original value of [X] we can define a Hoare rule for assignment 
    that does, intuitively, "work forwards" rather than backwards.

       {{fun st => P st /\ st X = m}}
         X ::= a
       {{fun st => P st' /\ st X = aeval st' a }}
       (where st' = t_update st X m)

    Note that we use the original value of [X] to reconstruct the
    state [st'] before the assignment took place. Prove that this rule
    is correct (the first hypothesis is the functional extensionality
    axiom, which you will need at some point). Also note that this
    rule is more complicated than [hoare_asgn].

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Consequence *)

(** Sometimes the preconditions and postconditions we get from the
    Hoare rules won't quite be the ones we want in the particular
    situation at hand -- they may be logically equivalent but have a
    different syntactic form that fails to unify with the goal we are
    trying to prove, or they actually may be logically weaker (for
    preconditions) or stronger (for postconditions) than what we need.
    For instance, while

      {{(X = 3) [X |-> 3]}} X ::= 3 {{X = 3}},

    follows directly from the assignment rule,

      {{True}} X ::= 3 {{X = 3}}

    does not.  This triple is valid, but it is not an instance of
    [hoare_asgn] because [True] and [(X = 3) [X |-> 3]] are not
    syntactically equal assertions.  However, they are logically
    equivalent, so if one triple is valid, then the other must
    certainly be as well.  We can capture this observation with the
    following rule:

                {{P'}} c {{Q}}
                  P <<->> P'
         -----------------------------   (hoare_consequence_pre_equiv)
                {{P}} c {{Q}}

    Taking this line of thought a bit further, we can see that
    strengthening the precondition or weakening the postcondition of a
    valid triple always produces another valid triple. This
    observation is captured by two _Rules of Consequence_.

                {{P'}} c {{Q}}
                   P ->> P'
         -----------------------------   (hoare_consequence_pre)
                {{P}} c {{Q}}

                {{P}} c {{Q'}}
                  Q' ->> Q
         -----------------------------    (hoare_consequence_post)
                {{P}} c {{Q}}
*)

(** Here are the formal versions: *)

Theorem hoare_consequence_pre : forall (P P' Q : Assertion) c,
  {{P'}} c {{Q}} ->
  P ->> P' ->

    X ::= 1
                {{ X = 1 }}

(** Finally, for convenience in some proofs, we can state a combined
    rule of consequence that allows us to vary both the precondition
    and the postcondition at the same time.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Digression: The [eapply] Tactic *)

(** This is a good moment to introduce another convenient feature of
    Coq.  We had to write "[with (P' := ...)]" explicitly in the proof
    of [hoare_asgn_example1] and [hoare_consequence] above, to make
    sure that all of the metavariables in the premises to the
    [hoare_consequence_pre] rule would be set to specific
    values.  (Since [P'] doesn't appear in the conclusion of
    [hoare_consequence_pre], the process of unifying the conclusion
    with the current goal doesn't constrain [P'] to a specific
    assertion.)

    This is annoying, both because the assertion is a bit long and
    also because, in [hoare_asgn_example1], the very next thing we are
    going to do -- applying the [hoare_asgn] rule -- will tell us
    exactly what it should be!  We can use [eapply] instead of [apply]
    to tell Coq, essentially, "Be patient: The missing part is going
    to be filled in later in the proof." *)

(** In order for [Qed] to succeed, all existential variables need to

(** An additional constraint is that existential variables cannot be

(** ** Conditionals *)

(** What sort of rule do we want for reasoning about conditional
    commands?  

    Certainly, if the same assertion [Q] holds after executing 
    either of the branches, then it holds after the whole conditional.  
    So we might be tempted to write:

              {{P}} c1 {{Q}}
              {{P}} c2 {{Q}}
      --------------------------------
      {{P}} IFB b THEN c1 ELSE c2 {{Q}}

   However, this is rather weak. For example, using this rule,
   we cannot show 

     {{ True }}
     IFB X == 0
     THEN Y ::= 2
     ELSE Y ::= X + 1
     FI
     {{ X <= Y }}

   since the rule tells us nothing about the state in which the
   assignments take place in the "then" and "else" branches. *)

(** Fortunately, we can say something more precise.  In the
    "then" branch, we know that the boolean expression [b] evaluates to
    [true], and in the "else" branch, we know it evaluates to [false].
    Making this information available in the premises of the rule gives
    us more information to work with when reasoning about the behavior
    of [c1] and [c2] (i.e., the reasons why they establish the
    postcondition [Q]). *)
(**

              {{P /\  b}} c1 {{Q}}
              {{P /\ ~b}} c2 {{Q}}
      ------------------------------------  (hoare_if)
      {{P}} IFB b THEN c1 ELSE c2 FI {{Q}}
*)

(** To interpret this rule formally, we need to do a little work.
    Strictly speaking, the assertion we've written, [P /\ b], is the
    conjunction of an assertion and a boolean expression -- i.e., it
    doesn't typecheck.  To fix this, we need a way of formally
    "lifting" any bexp [b] to an assertion.  We'll write [bassn b] for
    the assertion "the boolean expression [b] evaluates to [true] (in
    the given state)." *)

Definition bassn b : Assertion :=
  fun st => (beval st b = true).

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Loops *)

(** Finally, we need a rule for reasoning about while loops. *)

(** Suppose we have a loop

      WHILE b DO c END

    and we want to find a pre-condition [P] and a post-condition
    [Q] such that

      {{P}} WHILE b DO c END {{Q}}

    is a valid triple. *)

(** First of all, let's think about the case where [b] is false at the
    beginning -- i.e., let's assume that the loop body never executes
    at all.  In this case, the loop behaves like [SKIP], so we might
    be tempted to write: *)

(**

      {{P}} WHILE b DO c END {{P}}.
*)

(** But, as we remarked above for the conditional, we know a
    little more at the end -- not just [P], but also the fact
    that [b] is false in the current state.  So we can enrich the
    postcondition a little: *)
(**

      {{P}} WHILE b DO c END {{P /\ ~b}}
*)

(** What about the case where the loop body _does_ get executed?
    In order to ensure that [P] holds when the loop finally
    exits, we certainly need to make sure that the command [c]
    guarantees that [P] holds whenever [c] is finished.
    Moreover, since [P] holds at the beginning of the first
    execution of [c], and since each execution of [c]
    re-establishes [P] when it finishes, we can always assume
    that [P] holds at the beginning of [c].  This leads us to the
    following rule: *)
(**

                   {{P}} c {{P}}
        -----------------------------------
        {{P}} WHILE b DO c END {{P /\ ~b}}
*)
(** This is almost the rule we want, but again it can be improved a
    little: at the beginning of the loop body, we know not only that
    [P] holds, but also that the guard [b] is true in the current
    state.  This gives us a little more information to use in
    reasoning about [c] (showing that it establishes the invariant by
    the time it finishes).  This gives us the final version of the
    rule:
*)
(**

               {{P /\ b}} c {{P}}
        -----------------------------------  (hoare_while)
        {{P}} WHILE b DO c END {{P /\ ~b}}

    The proposition [P] is called an _invariant_ of the loop.
*)

Lemma hoare_while : forall P b c,
  {{fun st => P st /\ bassn b st}} c {{P}} ->
  {{P}} WHILE b DO c END {{fun st => P st /\ ~ (bassn b st)}}.
Proof.
  intros P b c Hhoare st st' He HP.
  (* Like we've seen before, we need to reason by induction
     on [He], because, in the "keep looping" case, its hypotheses
     talk about the whole loop instead of just [c]. *)

(** One subtlety in the terminology is that calling some assertion [P]
    a "loop invariant" doesn't just mean that it is preserved by the
    body of the loop in question (i.e., [{{P}} c {{P}}], where [c] is
    the loop body), but rather that [P] _together with the fact that
    the loop's guard is true_ is a sufficient precondition for [c] to
    ensure [P] as a postcondition.

    This is a slightly (but significantly) weaker requirement.  For
    example, if [P] is the assertion [X = 0], then [P] _is_ an
    invariant of the loop

    WHILE X = 2 DO X := 1 END

    although it is clearly _not_ preserved by the body of the
    loop. *)

(** We can use the while rule to prove the following Hoare triple,
    which may seem surprising at first... *)

(** Of course, this result is not surprising if we remember that
    the definition of [hoare_triple] asserts that the postcondition
    must hold _only_ when the command terminates.  If the command
    doesn't terminate, we can prove anything we like about the
    post-condition. *)

(** Hoare rules that only talk about terminating commands are
    often said to describe a logic of "partial" correctness.  It is
    also possible to give Hoare rules for "total" correctness, which

(** [REPEAT] behaves like [WHILE], except that the loop guard is

(** * Summary *)

(** So far, we've introduced Hoare Logic as a tool for reasoning about
    Imp programs.  In the reminder of this chapter we'll explore a
    systematic way to use Hoare Logic to prove properties about
    programs. The rules of Hoare Logic are:

             ------------------------------ (hoare_asgn)
             {{Q [X |-> a]}} X::=a {{Q}}

             --------------------  (hoare_skip)
             {{ P }} SKIP {{ P }}

               {{ P }} c1 {{ Q }}
               {{ Q }} c2 {{ R }}
              ---------------------  (hoare_seq)
              {{ P }} c1;;c2 {{ R }}

              {{P /\  b}} c1 {{Q}}
              {{P /\ ~b}} c2 {{Q}}
      ------------------------------------  (hoare_if)
      {{P}} IFB b THEN c1 ELSE c2 FI {{Q}}

               {{P /\ b}} c {{P}}
        -----------------------------------  (hoare_while)
        {{P}} WHILE b DO c END {{P /\ ~b}}

                {{P'}} c {{Q'}}
                   P ->> P'
                   Q' ->> Q
         -----------------------------   (hoare_consequence)
                {{P}} c {{Q}}

    In the next chapter, we'll see how these rules are used to prove
    that programs satisfy specifications of their behavior. *)
