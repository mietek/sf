(** * Overview *)

(** In this chapter we will introduce the QuickChick command-line
    tool, which supports testing of larger-scale projects than the
    examples we have seen so far. The command-line tool offers several
    useful features:
      - Batch processing, compilation and execution of tests
      - Mutation testing
      - Sectioning of tests and mutants

    This chapter reads a bit differently than most SF chapters, as it
    deals with a command-line tool. The code that it discusses, a
    simple compiler from a high-level expression language to a
    low-level stack machine, can be found in the directory
    [stack-compiler], broken up into two files: [Exp.v] containing the
    high-level expression languages and [Stack.v] containing the low-level
    stack machine and the compiler. The chapter's
    text will tell you what to type on the command line or where to
    look in the subdirectory as needed.

    To get started, let's try the tool out and see it's output! Go to
    the [stack-compiler] subdirectory and run the following command:

    quickChick -color -top Stack
*)

(** The [-color] flag colors certain lines in the output for easier reading.
    The [-top] flag controls the namespace for the compilation and should 
    be the same as the [-R] or [-Q] command in your [_CoqProject] file.
    Running this command should produce quite a bit of output in your
    terminal.
 *)

(**

    The output consists of four parts, delimited by (colored) headers such as 

    Testing base...

    or     

    Testing mutant 2 (./Exp.v: line 20): Plus-copy-paste-error

    Let's take a closer look at the first one.

    Testing base...
    make -f Makefile.coq 
    make[1]: Entering directory '/home/lemonidas/sfdev/qc/_qc_stack-compiler.tmp'
    COQDEP VFILES
    COQC Exp.v
    COQC Stack.v
    COQC QuickChickTop.v
    make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/lemonidas/sfdev/qc/_qc_stack-compiler.tmp'

    +++ Passed 10000 tests (0 discards)
    Checking Stack.compiles_correctly...
    +++ Passed 10000 tests (0 discards)
>>     

    As we will see later in this chapter, the [QuickChick] command-line tool
    gathers [QuickChick] tests from the sources and runs them together in one
    single, efficient extraction. To do that, it copies all the files (here [Exp.v]
    and [Stack.v]) in a new subdirectory that is a "sibling" of the current one 
    (that is both the directory where you ran [quickChick] and the new directory 
    are subdirectories of the same parent). This new directory is always named 
    [_qc_<DIRNAME>.tmp]. [QuickChick] also produces a new file
    [QuickChickTop.v] that contains all the tests that will be run and more 
    extraction directives. 

    Following the output of the [QuickChick] command-line tool, all it does is 
    compile everything in [_qc_stack-compiler.tmp], using the [Makefile] of 
    the original development as is and a [_CoqProject] modified to include the 
    new [QuickChickTop.v] file. This compilation leads to extracting all necessary
    files in _separate_ OCaml modules, which are in turn compiled using 
    [ocamlbuild], and then run. The separate extraction into distinct
    ocaml modules allows us to reuse compilation effort across different 
    mutants as well as different calls to [quickChick], as we can identify whether 
    newly extracted modules are actually different and recompile them or 
    not accordingly!

    The rest of the 3 parts of the output are similar, with the main difference
    being that instead of running all the tests on the unaltered, base development,
    they run the same tests on _mutated_ code. We will see exactly what 
    mutation testing is later in this chapter. 

    If all is well, the last line should be a reassuring success report:

    All tests produced the expected results
*)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Arithmetic Expressions *)

(** The code in the [stack-compiler] subdirectory consists of two
    modules, [Exp] and [Stack], each containing a number of
    definitions and properties. After some [Import]s at the top, the
    [Exp] module begins with a _section declaration_:

    (*! Section arithmetic_expressions *)

   
   We will explain what quickChick sections are and how to use them
   later in this chapter.
*)

(** It then defines a little arithmetic language, consisting of
    natural literals, addition, subtraction and multiplication. *)
Inductive exp : Type :=
  | ANum : nat -> exp
  | APlus : exp -> exp -> exp
  | AMinus : exp -> exp -> exp
  | AMult : exp -> exp -> exp.

(** Since [exp] is a simple datatype, QuickChick can derive a generator, a 
    shrinker, and a printer automatically. *)

Derive (Arbitrary, Show) for exp.

(** The [eval] function evaluates an expression to a number. *)
Fixpoint eval (e : exp) : nat :=
  match e with
  | ANum n => n
  | APlus e1 e2 => (eval e1) + (eval e2)
  | AMinus e1 e2  => (eval e1) - (eval e2)
  | AMult e1 e2 => (eval e1) * (eval e2)
  end.
(** (The actual definition in the file [Exp.v] contains a few more
    annotations in comments, defining a _mutant_. We will discuss
    these annotations later in this chapter. *)

(** Now let's write a simple optimization: whenever we see an
    unnecessary operation (adding/subtracting 0) we optimize it
    away. *)
Fixpoint optimize (e : exp) : exp :=
  match e with
  | ANum n => ANum n
  | APlus e (ANum 0)  => optimize e
  | APlus (ANum 0) e  => optimize e
  | APlus e1 e2 => APlus (optimize e1) (optimize e2)
  | AMinus e (ANum 0) => optimize e
  | AMinus e1 e2 => AMinus (optimize e1) (optimize e2)
  | AMult e1 e2 => AMult (optimize e1) (optimize e2)
  end.

(** Again, the actual definition in [Exp.v] contains again a few more
    annotations in comments (another section annotation and another
    mutant). *)

(** We can now write a simple correctness property for the optimizer,
    namely that evaluating an optimized expression yields the same
    number as evaluating the original one. *)

Definition optimize_correct_prop (e : exp) := eval (optimize e) = eval e?.

(** 

    (*! QuickChick optimize_correct_prop. *)
*)
(**

    QuickChecking optimize_correct_prop
    +++ Passed 10000 tests (0 discards)
*)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * QuickChick Test Annotations *)

(** In earlier chapters, we have included [QuickChick] commands in
    comments, with an invitation to the reader to uncomment and
    execute them. This has been done to avoid executing each and every
    test when compiling the volume as a whole. If we were to leave the
    [QuickChick] commands uncommented, then for each test we would
    extract the entire volume up to that point, compile the extracted
    OCaml, execute the test (up to 10000 tests by default for
    successes), and report the outcome.  While this process is often
    adequate for small developments, it quickly becomes intractable
    for large Coq files, multi-file developments, or large numbers of
    properties that need to be tested.

    One main feature of the command line tool is to gather all
    QuickChick commands, perform a _single_ extraction and compilation
    pass, and report the results for all tests. This is achieved with
    special QuickChick annotations. *)

(** Notice that this QuickChick comment, just like all
    QuickChick-specific annotations in the file, begin with an
    exclamation mark. _Comments that begin with an exclamation mark
    are special to the QuickChick command-line tool parser and signify
    a test, a section, or a mutant_.
 
    The annotation above defines a test of the property
    [optimize_correct_prop]. For simplicity, each test annotation
    requires a _named_ property, like [optimize_correct_prop]. That
    is, while inline one could successfully execute a command like the
    one below, the command-line tool requires a defined constant in
    the test annotation.

    QuickChick (fun e => eval (optimize e) = eval e?).
*)
(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Sections *)

(** When in the middle of a large development, it is useful to be able
    to concentrate your tests in the parts of the development you are
    actively changing. For example, if you are playing with the
    optimizer for your high-level language it is not ideal to spend
    time re-running the (successful) tests of the code generator. This
    is where QuickChick's sections come in.

    Sections are contiguous blocks of code within modules, and are
    allowed to depend on earlier ones. They contain sets of
    tests (and later on mutants) that correspond to a single aspect of
    the development and that are meant to be run together. *)

(** Thare are two kinds of section declarations in QuickChick.
    The first section declaration in the [Exp] module simply defines 
    the start of a new block that can be identified by the name 
    "arithmetic_expressions".

      (*! Section arithmetic_expressions *)

    The second also includes an [extends] clause. 

      (*! Section optimizations *)(*! extends arithmetic_expressions *)

   This signifies that this new block (until the end of the file, 
   in this case, since there are no further section headers), also 
   contains all tests and mutants from the [arithmetic_expressions] 
   section as well. 
*)

(** To see sectioning in action, execute the following command from
    the [stack-compiler] directory:

       quickChick -color -top Stack -s optimizations


    Testing base...
    make -f Makefile.coq 
    make[1]: Entering directory '/home/lemonidas/sfdev/qc/_qc_stack-compiler.tmp'
    COQDEP VFILES
    COQC Exp.v
    COQC Stack.v
    COQC QuickChickTop.v
    make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/lemonidas/sfdev/qc/_qc_stack-compiler.tmp'
    Checking Exp.optimize_correct_prop...
    +++ Passed 10000 tests (0 discards)
    ... etc ...

    In addition to the standard arguments ([-color], [-top Stack])
    we also specified that we only care about the [optimizations] section
    with the [-s] flag. Therefore this time, when testing the base 
    development, only the single test in [optimizations] was executed.
*)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Mutation Testing *)

(** The last major feature of the QuickChick command-line tool is
    _mutation testing_.

    A question that naturally arises when random testing a software
    artifact is whether the testing is actually good. Does our
    property succeed for 10000 tests because everything is correct, or
    because we are not covering enough of the input space? How much
    testing is enough? Mutation testing can be used to answer such
    questions, by intentionally introducing bugs in either the
    artifacts or the properties we are testing and then checking that
    the tests can detect them. *)

(** Here is an excerpt of the [eval] function with a simple mutant annotation:

       (*! *)                
         | APlus e1 e2 => (eval e1) + (eval e2)
       (*!! Plus-copy-paste-error *)                                 
       (*! | APlus e1 e2 => (eval e1) + (eval e1) *)

    Let's break it down into its parts.
*)

(** QuickChick mutants come in three parts. First, an annotation
    that signifies the beginning of a mutant. That is always the same:

       (*! *)

    This is followed by the correct code. In our example, by the evaluation
    of [APlus e1 e2]. 
   
    Afterwards, we can include an optional (but recommended) name for 
    the mutant, which begins with two exclamation marks to help the parser. 

       (*!! Plus-copy-paste-error *)                                 
]]  
  
    Finally, we include mutations of the original code, each in a QuickChick 
    single-exclamation-mark annotation. The code of the mutation is meant to be 
    able to verbatim replace the original code. Here, a copy-paste error 
    has been made to evaluate [e1] twice as both operands in an addition. *)

(** Similarly, in the [optimize] function we encounter the following mutant.

       (*! *)
         | AMinus e (ANum 0) => optimize e
       (*!! Minus-Reverse *)
       (*! 
         | AMinus (ANum 0) e => optimize e 
       *)

    This bug allows the optimization of [0-e] to [e] instead of [e-0] to [e]. *)

(** To see these mutants in action, let's look at the rest of the output of the
    last [quickChick] command we ran:

    quickChick -color -top Stack -s optimizations

    Testing mutant 0 (./Exp.v: line 35): Minus-Reverse
    make -f Makefile.coq 
    make[1]: Entering directory '/home/lemonidas/sfdev/qc/_qc_stack-compiler.tmp'

    AMinus (ANum 0) (ANum 1)
    Checking Exp.optimize_correct_prop...
    *** Failed after 13 tests and 4 shrinks. (0 discards)
     
    Testing mutant 1 (./Exp.v: line 20): Plus-copy-paste-error
    make -f Makefile.coq 
    make[1]: Entering directory '/home/lemonidas/sfdev/qc/_qc_stack-compiler.tmp'

    APlus (ANum 1) (ANum 0)
    Checking Exp.optimize_correct_prop...
    *** Failed after 5 tests and 3 shrinks. (0 discards)
    All tests produced the expected results

    After running all the tests for [base] (the unmutated artifact), the
    [quickChick] tool proceeds to run the single test in the [optimizations]
    section for each of the mutants it finds. Since the [optimizations] section
    _extends_ the [arithmetic_expressions] section, the mutants from both 
    sections will be included. As expected, the optimize property fails in 
    both cases. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * A Low-Level Stack Machine *)

(** The second module of our development is [Stack.v], which describes
    a low-level stack machine for arithmetic expressions. It contains
    a single section, [stack_instructions] which extends
    [arithmetic_expressions] but not [optimizations]. This allows us
    to independently run tests for the compiler or the optimzer
    without worrying about extra tests or mutants. *)

(** We begin by defining a low-level stack machine instruction set,
    which closely corresponds to the high-level expression language. *)
Inductive sinstr : Type :=
| SPush : nat -> sinstr
| SPlus : sinstr
| SMinus : sinstr
| SMult : sinstr.

(** Then we describe how to execute the stack machine. *)

Fixpoint execute (stack : list nat) (prog : list sinstr) : list nat :=
  match (prog, stack) with
  | (nil,             _           ) => stack
  | (SPush n::prog',  _           ) => execute (n::stack) prog'
  | (SPlus::prog',    m::n::stack') => execute ((m+n)::stack') prog'
  | (SMinus::prog',   m::n::stack') => execute ((m-n)::stack') prog'
  | (SMult::prog',    m::n::stack') => execute ((m*n)::stack') prog'
  | (_::prog',        _           ) => execute stack prog'
  end.

(** Given the current [stack] (a list of natural numbers) and the
    [prog]ram to be executed, we will produce a resulting stack.
      - If [prog] is empty, we return the current [stack]. 
      - To [Push] an integer, we cons it in the front of the list 
        and execute the remainder of the program.
      - To perform an arithmetic operation, we expect two integers
        at the top of the stack, operate, push the result, and execute
        the remainder of the program.
      - Finally, if such a thing is not possible (i.e. we tried to 
        perform a binary operation with less than 2 elements on the 
        stack), we ignore the instruction and proceed to the rest. *)

(** Now we can compile expressions to their corresponding
    stack-instruction sequences. *)

Fixpoint compile (e : exp) : list sinstr :=
  match e with
  | ANum n => [SPush n]
  | APlus  e1 e2 => compile e1 ++ compile e2 ++ [SPlus]
  | AMinus e1 e2 => compile e1 ++ compile e2 ++ [SMinus]
  | AMult  e1 e2 => compile e1 ++ compile e2 ++ [SMult]
  end.

(** In the compilation above we have made a rookie compiler-writer
    mistake.  (Can you spot it without running QuickChick?)

    The property we would expect to hold is that executing the
    compiled instruction sequence of a given expression [e], would
    result in a single element stack with [eval e] as its only
    element. *)

Definition compiles_correctly (e : exp) := (execute [] (compile e)) = [eval e]?.

(*! QuickChick compiles_correctly. *)

(** 

===>
    QuickChecking compiles_correctly
    AMinus (ANum 0) (ANum 1)
    *** Failed after 3 tests and 2 shrinks. (0 discards)

    The problem is that subtraction is not associative and we have compiled
    the two operands in the wrong order! We can now log that mutant in our 
    development as shown in the [Stack] module.

    Fixpoint compile (e : exp) : list sinstr :=
      match e with
      | ANum n => [SPush n]
    (*! *)
    | APlus  e1 e2 => compile e2 ++ compile e1 ++ [SPlus]
      | AMinus e1 e2 => compile e2 ++ compile e1 ++ [SMinus]
      | AMult  e1 e2 => compile e2 ++ compile e1 ++ [SMult]
    (*!! Wrong associativity *)
    (*!
      | APlus  e1 e2 => compile e1 ++ compile e2 ++ [SPlus]
      | AMinus e1 e2 => compile e1 ++ compile e2 ++ [SMinus]
      | AMult  e1 e2 => compile e1 ++ compile e2 ++ [SMult]
    *)
      end.

    
    We can now run a different command to test [compiles_correctly], using 
    [-s stack] to only check the [stack] section.

    quickChick -color -top Stack -s stack

    All tests produced the expected results

    We can see that the main property succeeds, while the two mutants (the one 
    in [arithmetic_expressions] that was included because of the extension
    and the one in [stack]) both fail. *)
