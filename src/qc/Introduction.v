(** * A First Taste of Testing *)

(** Consider the following definition of a function [remove], which
    takes a natural number [x] and a list of nats [l] and removes [x]
    from the list. *)

Fixpoint remove (x : nat) (l : list nat) : list nat :=
  match l with
    | []   => []
    | h::t => if h =? x then t else h :: remove x t
  end.

(** One possible specification for [remove] might be this property... *)

Conjecture removeP : forall x l,  ~ (In x (remove x l)).

(** ...which says that [x] never occurs in the result of [remove x l]
    for any [x] and [l].  ([Conjecture foo...] means the same as
    [Theorem foo... Admitted.]  Formally, [foo] is treated as an
    axiom.) *)

(** Sadly, this property is false, as we would (eventually) discover
    if we were to try to prove it. *)

(** A different -- perhaps much more efficient -- way to discover
    the discrepancy between the definition and specification is
    to _test_ it: *)

(* QuickChick removeP. *)

(** (Try uncommenting and evaluating the previous line.) *)

(** The [QuickChick] command takes an "executable" property (we'll see
    later exactly what this means) and attempts to falsify it by
    running it on many randomly generated inputs, resulting in output
    like this:

       0 
       [0, 0] 
       Failed! After 17 tests and 12 shrinks

    This means that, if we run [remove] with [x] being [0] and [l] 
    being the two-element list containing two zeros, then the property 
    [removeP] fails. *)

(** With this example in hand, we can see that the [then] branch
    of [remove] fails to make a recursive call, which means that only
    one occurence of [x] will be deleted. The last line of the output
    records that it took 17 tests to identify some fault-inducing
    input and 12 "shrinks" to reduce it to a minimal
    counterexample. *)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (insertP)

    Here is a somewhat mangled definition of a function for inserting a
    new element into a sorted list of numbers: *)

Fixpoint insert x l :=
  match l with
  | [] => [x]
  | y::t => if y <? x then insert x t else y::t
  end.

(** Write a property that says "inserting a number [x] into a list [l]
    always yields a list containing [x]."  Make sure QuickChick finds
    a counterexample. *)

(* FILL IN HERE

    [] *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard (insertP2)

    Translate the following claim into a [Conjecture] (using [In] for
    list membership): "For all numbers [x] and [y] and lists [l], if
    [y] is in [l] then it is also in the list that results from
    inserting [x] into [l]" (i.e., [insert] preserves all the elements
    already in [l]). Make sure QuickChick finds a counterexample. *)

(** * Overview *)

(** Property-based random testing involves four basic ingredients:

    - an _executable property_ like [removeP],
    - _generators_ for random elements of the types of the inputs to
      the property (here, numbers and lists of numbers),
    - _printers_ for converting data structures like numbers and lists
      to strings when reporting counterexamples, and
    - _shrinkers_, which are used to minimize counterexamples. *)

(** We will delve into each of these in detail later on, but first we
    need to make a digression to explain Coq's support for
    _typeclasses_, which QuickChick uses extensively both internally
    and in its programmatic interface to users.  This is the
    [Typeclasses] chapter.
    
    In the [QC] chapter we'll cover the core concepts and
    features of QuickChick itself.

    The [TImp] chapter develops a small case study around a typed
    variant of the Imp language.

    The [QuickChickTool] chapter presents a command line tool,
    _quickChick_, that supports larger-scale projects and mutation
    testing.

    The [QuickChickInterface] chapter is a complete reference
    manual for QuickChick.

    Finally, the [Postscript] chapter gives some suggestions for
    further reading. *)
