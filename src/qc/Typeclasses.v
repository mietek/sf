(** In real-world programming, it is often necessary to convert
    various kinds of data structures into strings so that they can be
    printed out, written to files, marshalled for sending over the
    network, or whatever.  This can be accomplished by writing string
    converters for each basic type

       - [showBool : bool -> string]
       - [showNat : nat -> string]
       - etc.
    
    plus combinators for structured types like [list] and pairs
 
       - [showList : {A : Type} 
                     (A -> string) -> (list A) -> string]
       - [showPair : {A B : Type} 
                     (A -> string) -> (B -> string) -> A * B -> string]

    that take string converters for their element types as arguments.
    Once we've done this, we can build string converters for more
    complex structured types by assembling them from these pieces:

       - [showListOfPairsOfNats = showList (showPair showNat showNat)]
 *)

(** While this idiom gets the job done, it feels a bit clunky in
    at least two ways.  First, it demands that we give names to all
    these string converters (which must later be remembered!) whereas
    it seems the names could really just be generated in a uniform way
    from the types involved.  Moreover, the definitions of converters
    like [showListOfPairsOfNats] are always derived in a quite
    mechanical way from their types, together with a small collection
    of primitive converters and converter combinators.

    The designers of Haskell addressed this clunkiness through
    _typeclasses_, a mechanism by which the typechecker is instructed
    to automatically construct "type-driven" functions 
    [Wadler and Blott 1989] (in Bib.v). (Readers not already familiar with 
    typeclasses should note that, although the word sounds a bit like 
    "classes" from object-oriented programming, this apparent connection 
    is rather misleading.  A better analogy is actually with _interfaces_
    from languages like Java.  But best of all is to set aside
    object-oriented preconceptions and try to approach typeclasses
    with an empty mind!)

    Many other modern language designs have followed Haskell's lead,
    and Coq is no exception.  However, because Coq's type system is so
    much richer than that of Haskell, and because typeclasses in Coq
    are used to automatically construct not only programs but also
    proofs, Coq's presentation of typeclasses is quite a bit less
    "transparent": to use typeclasses effectively, one must have a 
    fairly detailed understanding of how they are implemented.  Coq
    typeclasses are a power tool: they can make complex developments
    much more elegant and easy to manage when used properly, and they
    can cause a great deal of trouble when things go wrong!

    This tutorial introduces the core features of Coq's typeclasses,
    explains how they are implemented, surveys some useful typeclasses
    that can be found in Coq's standard library and other contributed
    libraries, and collects some advice about the pragmatics of using
    typeclasses. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Basics *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Classes and Instances *)

(** To automate converting various kinds of data into strings, we
    begin by defining a typeclass called [Show]. *)

Class Show A : Type :=
  {
    show : A -> string
  }.

(** The [Show] typeclass can be thought of as "classifying" types
    whose values can be converted to strings -- that is, types [A]
    such that we can define a function [show] of type [A -> string].
    
    We can declare that [bool] is such a type by giving an [Instance]
    declaration that witnesses this function: *)

Instance showBool : Show bool :=
  {
    show := fun b:bool => if b then "true" else "false"
  }.

Compute (show true).

(** Other types can similarly be equipped with [Show] instances --
    including, of course, new types that we define. *)

Inductive primary := Red | Green | Blue.

Instance showPrimary : Show primary :=
  {
    show :=
      fun c:primary =>
        match c with
        | Red => "Red"
        | Green => "Green"
        | Blue => "Blue"
        end
  }.

Compute (show Green).

(** The [show] function is sometimes said to be _overloaded_, since it
    can be applied to arguments of many types, with potentially
    radically different behavior depending on the type of its
    argument. *)

(** Converting natural numbers to strings is conceptually similar,
    though it requires a tiny bit of programming: *)

Fixpoint string_of_nat_aux (time n : nat) (acc : string) : string :=
  let d := match n mod 10 with
           | 0 => "0" | 1 => "1" | 2 => "2" | 3 => "3" | 4 => "4" | 5 => "5"
           | 6 => "6" | 7 => "7" | 8 => "8" | _ => "9"
           end in
  let acc' := d ++ acc in
  match time with
    | 0 => acc'
    | S time' =>
      match n / 10 with
        | 0 => acc'
        | n' => string_of_nat_aux time' n' acc'
      end
  end.

Definition string_of_nat (n : nat) : string :=
  string_of_nat_aux n n "".

Instance showNat : Show nat :=
  {
    show := string_of_nat
  }.

Compute (show 42).

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (showNatBool)

    Write a [Show] instance for pairs of a nat and a bool. *)

(* FILL IN HERE

    [] *)

(** Next, we can define functions that use the overloaded function
    [show] like this: *)

Definition showOne {A : Type} `{Show A} (a : A) : string :=
  "The value is " ++ show a.

Compute (showOne true).
Compute (showOne 42).

(** The parameter [`{Show A}] is a _class constraint_, which states
    that the function [showOne] is expected to be applied only to
    types [A] that belong to the [Show] class.

    Concretely, this constraint should be thought of as an extra
    parameter to [showOne] supplying _evidence_ that [A] is an
    instance of [Show] -- i.e., it is essentially just a [show]
    function for [A], which is implicitly invoked by the expression
    [show a]. *)

(** More interestingly, a single function can come with multiple class
    constraints: *)

Definition showTwo {A B : Type}
           `{Show A} `{Show B} (a : A) (b : B) : string :=
  "First is " ++ show a ++ " and second is " ++ show b.

Compute (showTwo true 42).
Compute (showTwo Red Green).

(** In the body of [showTwo], the type of the argument to each
    instance of [show] determines which of the implicitly supplied
    show functions (for [A] or [B]) gets invoked. *)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (missingConstraint)

    What happens if we forget the class constraints in the definitions
    of [showOne] or [showTwo]?  Try deleting them and see what
    happens.

    [] *)    

(** Of course, [Show] is not the only interesting typeclass.  There
    are many other situations where it is useful to be able to
    choose (and construct) specific functions depending on the type of
    an argument that is supplied to a generic function like [show].
    Another typical example is equality checkers. *)

(** Here is another basic example of typeclasses: a class [Eq]
    describing types with a (boolean) test for equality. *)

Class Eq A :=
  {
    eqb: A -> A -> bool;
  }.

Notation "x =? y" := (eqb x y) (at level 70).

(** And here are some basic instances: *)

Instance eqBool : Eq bool :=
  {
    eqb := fun (b c : bool) => 
       match b, c with
         | true, true => true
         | true, false => false
         | false, true => false
         | false, false => true
       end
  }.

Instance eqNat : Eq nat :=
  {
    eqb := Nat.eqb
  }.

(** One possible confusion should be addressed here: Why should we
    need to define a typeclass for boolean equality when Coq's
    _propositional_ equality ([x = y]) is completely generic?  The
    answer is that, while it makes sense to _claim_ that two values
    [x] and [y] are equal no matter what their type is, it is not
    possible to write a decidable equality _checker_ for arbitrary
    types.  In particular, equality at types like [nat->nat] is
    undecidable. *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard, optional (boolArrowBool)

    There are some function types, like [bool->bool], for which
    checking equality makes perfect sense.  Write an [Eq] instance for
    this type. *)

(* FILL IN HERE

    [] *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Parameterized Instances: New Typeclasses from Old *)

(** What about a [Show] instance for pairs? *)

(** Since we can have pairs of any types, we'll want to parameterize
    our [Show] instance by two types.  Moreover, we'll need to
    constrain both of these types to be instances of [Show]. *)

Instance showPair {A B : Type} `{Show A} `{Show B} : Show (A * B) :=
  {
    show p :=
      let (a,b) := p in 
        "(" ++ show a ++ "," ++  show b ++ ")"
  }.

Compute (show (true,42)).

(** Similarly, here is an [Eq] instance for pairs... *)

Instance eqPair {A B : Type} `{Eq A} `{Eq B} : Eq (A * B) :=
  {
    eqb p1 p2 :=
      let (p1a,p1b) := p1 in
      let (p2a,p2b) := p2 in
      andb (p1a =? p2a) (p1b =? p2b)
  }.

(** ...and here is [Show] for lists: *)

Fixpoint showListAux {A : Type} (s : A -> string) (l : list A) : string :=
  match l with
    | nil => ""
    | cons h nil => s h
    | cons h t => append (append (s h) ", ") (showListAux s t)
  end.

Instance showList {A : Type} `{Show A} : Show (list A) :=
  {
    show l := append "[" (append (showListAux show l) "]")
  }.

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (eqEx)

    Write an [Eq] instance for lists and [Show] and [Eq] instances for
    the [option] type constructor. *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard, optional (boolArrowA)

    Generalize your solution to the [boolArrowBool] exercise to build
    an equality instance for any type of the form [bool->A], where [A]
    itself is an [Eq] type.  Show that it works for [bool->bool->nat]. *)

(* FILL IN HERE

    [] *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Class Hierarchies *)

(** We often want to organize typeclasses into hierarchies.  For
    example, we might want a typeclass [Ord] for "ordered types" that
    support both equality and a less-or-equal comparison operator. *)

(** A possible (but bad) way to do this is to define a new class with
    two associated functions: *)

Class OrdBad A :=
  {
    eqbad : A -> A -> bool;
    lebad : A -> A -> bool
  }.

(** The reason this is bad is because we now need to use a new
    equality operator ([eqbad]) if we want to test for equality on
    ordered values. *)

Definition lt {A: Type} `{Eq A} `{OrdBad A} (x y : A) : bool :=
  andb (lebad x y) (negb (eqbad x y)).

(** A much better way is to parameterize the definition of [Ord] on an
    [Eq] class constraint: *)

Class Ord A `{Eq A} : Type :=
  {
    le : A -> A -> bool
  }.

Check Ord.

(** (The old class [Eq] is sometimes called a "superclass" of [Ord],
    but, again, this terminology is potentially confusing: Try to
    avoid thinking about analogies with object-oriented
    programming!) *) 

(** When we define instances of [Ord], we just have to implement the
    [le] operation. *)

Instance natOrd : Ord nat :=
  {
    le := Nat.leb
  }.

(** Functions expecting to be instantiated with an instance of [Ord]
    now have two class constraints, one witnessing that they have an
    associated [eqb] operation, and one for [le]. *)

Definition max {A: Type} `{Eq A} `{Ord A} (x y : A) : A :=
  if le x y then y else x.

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (missingConstraintAgain)

    What does Coq say if the [Ord] class constraint is left out of the
    definition of [max]?  What about the [Eq] class constraint?

(** * How It Works *)

(** Typeclasses in Coq are a powerful tool, but the expressiveness of
    the Coq logic makes it hard to implement sanity checks like
    Haskell's "overlapping instances" detector.

    As a result, using Coq's typeclasses effectively -- and figuring
    out what is wrong when things don't work -- requires a clear
    understanding of the underlying mechanisms. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Implicit Generalization *)

(** The first thing to understand is exactly what the "backtick"
    notation means in declarations of classes, instances, and
    functions using typeclasses.  This is actually a quite generic
    mechanism, called _implicit generalization_, that was added to Coq
    to support typeclasses but that can also be used to good effect
    elsewhere.

    The basic idea is that unbound variables mentioned in bindings
    marked with [`] are automatically bound in front of the binding
    where they occur. *)

(** To enable this behavior for a particular variable, say [A], we
    first declare [A] to be implicitly generalizable: *)

Generalizable Variables A.  

(** By default, Coq only implicitly generalizes variables declared in
    this way, to avoid puzzling behavior in case of typos.  There is
    also a [Generalize Variables All] command, but it's probably not a
    good idea to use it! *)

(** Now, for example, we can shorten the declaration of the [showOne]
    function by omitting the binding for [A] at the front. *)

Definition showOne1 `{Show A} (a : A) : string :=
  "The value is " ++ show a.

(** Coq will notice that the occurrence of [A] inside the [`{...}] is
    unbound and automatically insert the binding that we wrote
    explicitly before. *)

Print showOne1.
(* ==>
    showOne1 = 
      fun (A : Type) (H : Show A) (a : A) => "The value is " ++ show a
           : forall A : Type, Show A -> A -> string

    Arguments A, H are implicit and maximally inserted
*)

(** The "implicit and maximally generalized" annotation on the last
    line means that the automatically inserted bindings are treated as
    if they had been written with [{...}], rather than [(...)].  The
    "implicit" part means that the type argument [A] and the [Show]
    witness [H] are usually expected to be left implicit: whenever we
    write [showOne1], Coq will automatically insert two unification
    variables as the first two arguments.  This automatic insertion
    can be disabled by writing [@], so a bare occurrence of [showOne1]
    means the same as [@showOne1 _ _].  The "maximally inserted" part
    says that these arguments should inserted automatically even when
    there is no following explicit argument. *)

(** In fact, even the [`{Show A}] form hides one bit of implicit
    generalization: the bound name of the [Show] constraint itself.
    You will sometimes see class constraints written more explicitly,
    like this... *)

Definition showOne2 `{_ : Show A} (a : A) : string :=
  "The value is " ++ show a.

(** ... or even like this: *)

Definition showOne3 `{H : Show A} (a : A) : string :=
  "The value is " ++ show a.

(** The advantage of the latter form is that it gives a name that can
    be used, in the body, to explicitly refer to the supplied evidence
    for [Show A].  This can be useful when things get complicated and
    you want to make your code more explicit so you can better
    understand and control what's happening. *)

(** We can actually go one bit further and omit [A] altogether, with
    no change in meaning (though, again, this may be more confusing
    than helpful): *)

Definition showOne4 `{Show} a : string :=
  "The value is " ++ show a.

(** If we ask Coq to print the arguments that are normally implicit,
    we see that all these definitions are exactly the same
    internally. *)

Set Printing Implicit.
Print showOne.
Print showOne1.
Print showOne2.
Print showOne3.
Print showOne4.
(* ==> 
    showOne = 
        fun (A : Type) (H : Show A) (a : A) => 
          "The value is " ++ @show A H a
      : forall A : Type, Show A -> A -> string
*)
Unset Printing Implicit.

(** The examples we've seen so far illustrate how implicit
    generalization works, but you may not be convinced yet that it is
    actually saving enough keystrokes to be worth the trouble of
    adding such a fancy mechanism to Coq.  Where things become more
    convincing is when classes are organized into hierarchies.  For
    example, here is an alternate definition of the [max] function: *)

Definition max1 `{Ord A} (x y : A) :=
  if le x y then y else x.

(** If we print out [max1] in full detail, we can see that the
    implicit generalization around [`{Ord A}] led Coq to fill in not
    only a binding for [A] but also a binding for [H], which it can
    see must be of type [Eq A] because it appears as the second
    argument to [Ord].  (And why is [Ord] applied here to two
    arguments instead of just the one, [A], that we wrote?  Because
    [Ord]'s arguments are maximally inserted!) *)

Set Printing Implicit.
Print max1.
(* ==>
     max1 = 
       fun (A : Type) (H : Eq A) (H0 : @Ord A H) (x y : A) =>
         if @le A H H0 x y then y else x

   : forall (A : Type) (H : Eq A), 
       @Ord A H -> A -> A -> A    
*)

Check Ord.
(* ==> Ord : forall A : Type, Eq A -> Type *)

Unset Printing Implicit.

(** For completeness, a couple of final points about implicit
    generalization.  First, it can be used in situations where no
    typeclasses at all are involved.  For example, we can use it to
    write quantified propositions mentioning free variables, following
    the common informal convention that these are to be quantified
    implicitly. *)

Generalizable Variables x y.

Check commutativity_property.

(** The previous examples have all shown implicit generalization being
    used to fill in forall binders.  It will also create [fun]
    binders, when this makes sense: *)

Definition implicit_fun := `{x + y}.

(** Defining a function in this way is not very natural, however.  In
    particular, the arguments are all implicit and maximally
    inserted (as can be seen if we print out its definition)... *)

Print implicit_fun.

(** ... so we will need to use @ to actually apply the function: *)

(* Compute (implicit_fun 2 3). *)
(* ==> 
    Error: Illegal application (Non-functional construction): 
    The expression "implicit_fun" of type "nat"
    cannot be applied to the term
     "2" : "nat"
*)

Compute (@implicit_fun 2 3).

(** Writing [`(...)], with parentheses instead of curly braces, causes
    Coq to perform the same implicit generalization step, but does
    _not_ mark the inserted binders themselves as implicit. *)

Definition implicit_fun1 := `(x + y).
Print implicit_fun1.
Compute (implicit_fun1 2 3).

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Records are Products *)

(** Although records are not part of its core, Coq does provide some
    simple syntactic sugar for defining and using records. *)

(** Record types must be declared before they are used.  For example:*)

Record Point :=
  Build_Point
    {
      px : nat;
      py : nat
    }.

(** Internally, this declaration is desugared into a single-field
    inductive type, roughly like this: 

    Inductive Point : Set := 
      | Build_Point : nat -> nat -> Point.
*)

(** Elements of this type can be built, if we like, by applying the
    [Build_Point] constructor directly.
*)

Check (Build_Point 2 4).

(** Or we can use more familar record syntax, which allows us to name
    the fields and write them in any order: *)

Check {| px := 2; py := 4 |}.
Check {| py := 4; px := 2 |}.

(** We can also access fields of a record using conventional "dot notation" 
    (with slightly clunky concrete syntax): *)

Definition r : Point := {| px := 2; py := 4 |}.

Compute (r.(px) + r.(py)).

(** Record declarations can also be parameterized: *)

Record LabeledPoint (A : Type) :=
  Build_LabeledPoint
    {
      lx    : nat;
      ly    : nat;
      label : A
    }.

(** (Note that the field names have to be different.  Any given field
    name can belong to only one record type.  This greatly simplifies
    type inference!) *)

Check {| lx:=2; ly:=4; label:="hello" |}.
(* ==> 
     {| lx := 2; ly := 4; label := "hello" |}
        : LabeledPoint string
*)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (rcdParens)

    Note that the [A] parameter in the definition of [LabeledPoint] is
    bound with parens, not curly braces. Why is this a better choice?

    [] *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Typeclasses are Records *)

(** Typeclasses and instances, in turn, are basically just syntactic
    sugar for record types and values (together with a bit of magic
    for using proof search to fill in appropriate instances during
    typechecking, as described below).

    Internally, a typeclass declaration is elaborated into a
    parameterized [Record] declaration: *)

Set Printing All.
Print Show.
(* ==> 
    Record Show (A : Type) : Type := 
      Build_Show
        { show : A -> string } 
*)
Unset Printing All.
(** (If you run the [Print] command yourself, you'll see that [Show]
    actually displays as a [Variant]; this is Coq's terminology for a
    single-field record.) *)

(** Analogously, [Instance] declarations become record values: *)

Print showNat.
(* ==>
    showNat = {| show := string_of_nat |}
       : Show nat
*)

(** Note that the syntax for record values is slightly different from
    [Instance] declarations.  Record values are written with
    curly-brace-vertical-bar delimiters, while [Instance] declarations
    are written here with just curly braces.  (To be precise, both
    forms of braces are actually allowed for [Instance] declarations,
    and either will work in most situations; however, type inference
    sometimes works a bit better with bare curly braces.) *)

(** Similarly, overloaded functions like [show] are really just record
    projections, which in turn are just functions that select a
    particular argument of a one-constructor [Inductive] type. *)

Set Printing All.
Print show.
(* ==>
    show = 
      fun (A : Type) (Show0 : Show A) =>
        match Show0 with
          | Build_Show _ show => show
        end
   : forall (A : Type), Show A -> A -> string 

   Arguments A, Show are implicit and maximally inserted  *)
Unset Printing All.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Inferring Instances *)

(** So far, all the mechanisms we've seen have been pretty simple
    syntactic sugar and binding munging.  The real "special sauce" of
    typeclasses is the way appropriate instances are automatically
    inferred (and/or constructed!) during typechecking. *)

(** For example, if we write [show 42], what we actually get is 
    [@show nat showNat 42]: *)

Definition eg42 := show 42.

Set Printing Implicit.
Print eg42.
Unset Printing Implicit.

(** How does this happen? *)

(** First, since the arguments to [show] are marked implicit, what we
    typed is automatically expanded to [@show _ _ 42].  The first [_]
    should obviously be replaced by [nat].  But what about the second?

    By ordinary type inference, Coq knows that, to make the whole
    expression well typed, the second argument to [@show] must be a
    value of type [Show nat].  It attempts to find or construct such a
    value using a variant of the [eauto] proof search procedure that
    refers to a "hint database" called [typeclass_instances]. *)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (HintDb)

    Uncomment and execute the following command.  Search for "For
    Show" in the output and have a look at the entries for [showNat]
    and [showPair]. *)

(* Print HintDb typeclass_instances.

    [] *)

(** We can see what's happening during the instance inference process
    if we issue the [Set Typeclasses Debug] command. *)

Set Typeclasses Debug.
Check (show 42).
(* ==>
     Debug: 1: looking for (Show nat) without backtracking
     Debug: 1.1: exact showNat on (Show nat), 0 subgoal(s)
*)

(** In this simple example, the proof search succeeded immediately
    because [showNat] was in the hint database.  In more interesting
    cases, the proof search needs to try to assemble an _expression_

(** * Typeclasses and Proofs *)

(** Since programs and proofs in Coq are fundamentally made from the
    same stuff, the mechanisms of typeclasses extend smoothly to
    situations where classes contain not only data and functions but
    also proofs.

    This is a big topic -- too big for a basic tutorial -- but let's
    take a quick look at a few things. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Propositional Typeclass Members *)

(** The [Eq] typeclass defines a single overloaded function that tests
    for equality between two elements of some type.  We can extend
    this to a subclass that also comes with a proof that the given
    equality tester is correct, in the sense that, whenever it returns
    [true], the two values are actually equal in the propositional
    sense (and vice versa).
*)

Class EqDec (A : Type) {H : Eq A} := 
  { 
    eqb_eq : forall x y, x =? y = true <-> x = y 
  }.

(** To build an instance of [EqDec], we must now supply an appropriate
    proof. *)

Instance eqdecNat : EqDec nat := 
  {
    eqb_eq := Nat.eqb_eq
  }.

(** If we do not happen to have an appropriate proof already in the
    environment, we can simply omit it. Coq will enter
    proof mode and ask the user to use tactics to construct
    inhabitants for the fields. *)

Instance eqdecBool' : EqDec bool.
Proof.
  constructor.
  intros x y. destruct x; destruct y; simpl; unfold iff; auto.
Defined.

(** Given a typeclass with propositional members, we can use these
    members in proving things involving this typeclass. *)

(** Here, for example, is a quick (and somewhat contrived)
    example of a proof of a property that holds for arbitrary values
    from the [EqDec] class... *)

Lemma eqb_fact `{EqDec A} : forall (x y z : A),
  x =? y = true -> y =? z = true -> x = z.
Proof.
  intros x y z Exy Eyz. 
  rewrite eqb_eq in Exy.
  rewrite eqb_eq in Eyz.
  subst. reflexivity. Qed.

(** There is much more to say about how typeclasses can be used (and
    how they should not be used) to support large-scale proofs in Coq.
    See the suggested readings below. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Substructures *)

(** Naturally, it is also possible to have typeclass instances as
    members of other typeclasses: these are called _substructures_.
    Here is an example adapted from the Coq Reference Manual. *)

From Coq Require Import Relations.Relation_Definitions.

Class Reflexive (A : Type) (R : relation A) :=
  { 
    reflexivity : forall x, R x x
  }.

Class Transitive (A : Type) (R : relation A) :=
  {
    transitivity : forall x y z, R x y -> R y z -> R x z
  }.

Generalizable Variables z w R.

Lemma trans3 : forall `{Transitive A R}, 
    `{R x y -> R y z -> R z w -> R x w}.
Proof.
  intros.
  apply (transitivity x z w). apply (transitivity x y z).
  assumption. assumption. assumption. Defined.

Class PreOrder (A : Type) (R : relation A) :=
  { PreOrder_Reflexive :> Reflexive A R ;
    PreOrder_Transitive :> Transitive A R }.

(** The syntax [:>] indicates that each [PreOrder] can be seen as a
    [Reflexive] and [Transitive] relation, so that, any time a
    reflexive relation is needed, a preorder can be used instead. *)

Lemma trans3_pre : forall `{PreOrder A R}, 
    `{R x y -> R y z -> R z w -> R x w}.
Proof. intros. eapply trans3; eassumption. Defined.

(** * Some Useful Typeclasses *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** [Dec] *)

(** The [ssreflect] library defines what it means for a proposition
    [P] to be decidable like this... *)

Require Import ssreflect ssrbool.

Print decidable.
(* ==>
     decidable = fun P : Prop => {P} + {~ P}
*)

(** ... where [{P} + {~ P}] is an "informative disjunction" of [P] and
    [~P].  *)

(** It is easy to wrap this in a typeclass of "decidable
    propositions": *)

Class Dec (P : Prop) : Type :=
  {
    dec : decidable P
  }.

(** We can now create instances encoding the information that
    propositions of various forms are decidable.  For example, the
    proposition [x = y] is decidable (for any specific [x] and [y]),
    assuming that [x] and [y] belong to a type with an [EqDec]
    instance. *)

Instance EqDec__Dec {A} `{H : EqDec A} (x y : A) : Dec (x = y).
Proof.
  constructor.
  unfold decidable.
  destruct (x =? y) eqn:E.
  - left. rewrite <- eqb_eq. assumption.
  - right. intros C. rewrite <- eqb_eq in C. rewrite E in C. inversion C.
Defined.

(** Similarly, we can lift decidability through logical operators like
    conjunction: *)

Instance Dec_conj {P Q} {H : Dec P} {I : Dec Q} : Dec (P /\ Q).
Proof.
  constructor. unfold decidable.
  destruct H as [D]; destruct D;
    destruct I as [D]; destruct D; auto;
      right; intro; destruct H; contradiction.
Defined.

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (dec_neg_disj)

    Give instance declarations showing that, if [P] and [Q] are
    decidable propositions, then so are [~P] and [P\/Q]. *)

(* FILL IN HERE

    [] *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, standard (Dec_All)

    The following function converts a list into a proposition claiming
    that every element of that list satiesfies some proposition
    [P]: *)

Fixpoint All {T : Type} (P : T -> Prop) (l : list T) : Prop :=
  match l with
  | [] => True
  | x :: l' => P x /\ All P l'
  end.

(** Create an instance of [Dec] for [All P l], given that [P a] is
    decidable for every [a]. *)

(* FILL IN HERE

    [] *)

(** One reason for doing all this is that it makes it easy to move
    back and forth between the boolean and propositional worlds,
    whenever we know we are dealing with decidable propositions.

    In particular, we can define a notation [P?] that converts a
    decidable proposition [P] into a boolean expression. *)

Notation "P '?'" :=
  (match (@dec P _) with 
   | left _ => true
   | right _ => false
   end)
  (at level 100).

(** Now we don't need to remember that, for example, the test for
    equality on numbers is called [eqb], because instead of this... *)

Definition silly_fun1 (x y z : nat) :=
  if andb (x =? y) (andb (y =? z) (x =? z))
  then "all equal"
  else "not all equal".

(** ... we can just write this: *)

Definition silly_fun2 (x y z : nat) :=
  if (x = y /\ y = z /\ x = z)?
  then "all equal"
  else "not all equal".

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** [Monad] *)

(** In Haskell, one place typeclasses are used very heavily is with
    the [Monad] typeclass, especially in conjunction with Haskell's
    "[do] notation" for monadic actions.

    Monads are an extremely powerful tool for organizing and
    streamlining code in a wide range of situations where computations
    can be thought of as yielding a result along with some kind of
    "effect."  Examples of possible effects include
       - input / output
       - state mutation
       - failure
       - nondeterminism
       - randomness
       - etc. *)

(** There are many good tutorials on the web about monadic programming
    in Haskell.  Readers who have never seen monads before may want to
    refer to one of these to fully understand the examples here. *)

(** In Coq, monads are also heavily used, but the fact that
    typeclasses are a relatively recent addition to Coq, together with
    the fact that Coq's [Notation] extension mechanism allows users to
    define their own variants of [do] notation for specific situations
    where a monadic style is useful, have led to a proliferation of
    definitions of monads: most older projects simply define their own
    monads and monadic notations -- sometimes typeclass-based, often
    not -- while newer projects use one of several generic libraries
    for monads.  Our current favorite (as of Summer 2017) is the monad
    typeclasses in Gregory Malecha's [ext-lib] package:

    https://github.com/coq-ext-lib/coq-ext-lib/blob/v8.5/theories/Structures/Monad.v

    Once the [ext-lib] package is installed (e.g., via OPAM), we can write: *)

Require Export ExtLib.Structures.Monads.
Export MonadNotation.
Open Scope monad_scope.

(** The main definition provided by this library is the following typeclass:

    Class Monad (M : Type -> Type) : Type :=
       { 
         ret : forall {T : Type}, T -> M T ;
         bind : forall {T U : Type}, M T -> (T -> M U) -> M U
       }.
*)
(** That is, a type family [M] is an instance of the [Monad] class if
    we can define functions [ret] and [bind] of the appropriate types.

    (If you [Print] the actual definition, you'll see something more
    complicated, involving [Polymorphic Record bla bla]...  The
    [Polymorphic] part refers to Coq's "universe polymorphism," which
    does not concern us here.) *)

(** For example, we can define a monad instance for [option] like
    this: *)

Instance optionMonad : Monad option :=
  {
    ret T x :=
      Some x ;
    bind T U m f :=
      match m with
        None => None
      | Some x => f x
      end
  }.

(** The other nice thing we get from the [Monad] library is
    lightweight notation for bind: Instead of

      bind m1 (fun x => m2),

    we can write

      x <- m1 ;; m2.
]]  
    Or, if the result from [m1] is not needed in [m2], then instead of

      bind m1 (fun _ => m2),

we can write

      m1 ;; m2.
*)

(** This allows us to write functions involving "option plumbing" very
    compactly.

    For example, suppose we have a function that looks up the [n]th
    element of a list, returning [None] if the list contains less than
    [n] elements. *)

Fixpoint nth_opt {A : Type} (n : nat) (l : list A) : option A :=
  match l with
    [] => None
  | h::t => if n =? 0 then Some h else nth_opt (n-1) t
  end.

(** We can write a function that sums the first three elements of a
    list (returning [None] if the list is too short) like this: *)

Definition sum3 (l : list nat) : option nat :=
  x0 <- nth_opt 0 l ;;
  x1 <- nth_opt 1 l ;;
  x2 <- nth_opt 2 l ;;
  ret (x0 + x1 + x2).

(** One final convenience for programming with monads is a collection
    of operators for "lifting" functions on ordinary values to
    functions on monadic computations.  [ExtLib] defines three -- one
    for unary functions, one for binary, and one for ternary.  The
    definitions (slightly simplified) look like this: *)

Definition liftM
            {m : Type -> Type}
            {M : Monad m}
            {T U : Type} (f : T -> U)
          : m T -> m U :=
  fun x => bind x (fun x => ret (f x)).

Definition liftM2
            {m : Type -> Type}
            {M : Monad m}
            {T U V : Type} (f : T -> U -> V) 
          : m T -> m U -> m V :=
    fun x y => bind x (fun x => liftM (f x) y).

Definition liftM3
            {m : Type -> Type}
            {M : Monad m}
            {T U V W : Type} (f : T -> U -> V -> W) 
          : m T -> m U -> m V -> m W :=
    fun x y z => bind x (fun x => liftM2 (f x) y z).

(** For example, suppose we have two [option nat]s and we would like
    to calculate their sum (unless one of them is [None], in which
    case we want [None]).  Instead of this... *)

Definition sum3opt (n1 n2 : option nat) :=
  x1 <- n1 ;;
  x2 <- n2 ;;
  ret (x1 + x2).

(** ...we can use [liftM2] to write it more compactly: *)

Definition sum3opt' (n1 n2 : option nat) :=
  liftM2 plus n1 n2.

(** The [/examples] directory in the [ext-lib] Github
    repository (https://github.com/coq-ext-lib/coq-ext-lib) includes
    some further examples of using monads in Coq. *)

(* ================================================================= *)

(** Two popular typeclasses from the Coq standard library are
    [Equivalence] (and the associated classes [Reflexive],
    [Transitive], etc.) and [Proper].  They are described in the
    second half of _A Gentle Introduction to Type Classes and
    Relations in Coq_, by Castéran and Sozeau.

(** ... says that it works for any [Eq] type.  Naturally, we can use

Definition foo x := if x =? x then "Of course" else "Impossible".

(** ... and then we can apply [foo] to arguments of any [Eq] type.

(* ==>
     The command has indeed failed with message:
     The term "true" has type "bool" while it is expected 
       to have type "bool -> bool". *)

(** Huh?! *)

(** Here's what happened:
      - When we defined [foo], the type of [x] was not specified, so
        Coq filled in a unification variable (an "evar") [?A].
      - When typechecking the expression [eqb x], the typeclass
        instance mechanism was asked to search for a type-correct
        instance of [Eq], i.e., an expression of type [Eq ?A].
      - This search immediately succeeded because the first thing it
        tried worked; this happened to be the constant [eqBoolBool :
        Eq (bool->bool)].  In the process, [?A] got instantiated to
        [bool->bool].
      - The type calculated for [foo] was therefore
        [(bool->bool)->(bool->bool)->bool].

    The lesson is that it matters a great deal _exactly_ what problems
    are posed to the instance search engine. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Manipulating the Hint Database *)

(** One of the ways in which Coq's typeclasses differ most from
    Haskell's is the lack, in Coq, of an automatic check for
    "overlapping instances."

    That is, it is completely legal to define a given type to be an
    instance of a given class in two different ways. *)

Inductive baz := Baz : nat -> baz.

Instance baz1 : Show baz :=
  {
    show b :=
      match b with
        Baz n => "Baz: " ++ show n
      end
  }.

Instance baz2 : Show baz :=
  {
    show b :=
      match b with
        Baz n => "[" ++ show n ++ " is a Baz]"
      end
  }.

Compute (show (Baz 42)).
(* ==> 
     = "[42 is a Baz]"
     : string   *)

(** When this happens, it is unpredictable which instance will be
    found first by the instance search process; here it just happened
    to be the second. The reason Coq doesn't do the overlapping
    instances check is because its type system is much more complex
    than Haskell's -- so much so that it is very challenging in
    general to decide whether two given instances overlap.

    The reason this is unfortunate is that, in more complex
    situations, it may not be obvious when there are overlapping
    instances. *)

(** One way to deal with overlapping instances is to "curate" the hint
    database by explicitly adding and removing specific instances.  

    To remove things, use [Remove Hints]: *)

Remove Hints baz1 baz2 : typeclass_instances.

(** To add them back (or to add arbitrary constants that have the
    right type to be intances -- i.e., their type ends with an applied
    typeclass -- but that were not created by [Instance] declarations),
    use [Existing Instance]: *)

Existing Instance baz1.
Compute (show (Baz 42)).
(* ==> 
     = "Baz: 42"
     : string    *)

Remove Hints baz1 : typeclass_instances.

(** Another way of controlling which instances are chosen by proof
    search is to assign _priorities_ to overlapping instances: *)

Instance baz3 : Show baz | 2 :=
  {
    show b :=
      match b with
        Baz n => "Use me first!  " ++ show n
      end
  }.

Instance baz4 : Show baz | 3 :=
  {
    show b :=
      match b with
        Baz n => "Use me second!  " ++ show n
      end
  }.

Compute (show (Baz 42)).
(* ==> 
     = "Use me first!  42"
     : string  *)

(** 0 is the highest priority.

    If the priority is not specified, it defaults to the number of
    binders of the instance.  (This means that more specific -- less
    polymorphic -- instances will be chosen over less specific
    ones.) *)

(** [Existing Instance] declarations can also be given explicit
    priorities. *)

(** * Debugging *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Instantiation Failures *)

(** One downside of using typeclasses, especially many typeclasses at
    the same time, is that error messages can become puzzling.

    Here are some relatively easy ones. *)

Inductive bar :=
  Bar : nat -> bar.

Fail Definition eqBar :=
  (Bar 42) =? (Bar 43).

(* ===>

(* ===>
    The command has indeed failed with message:
    Unable to satisfy the following constraints:
      ?H : "Eq (list bar)"
      ?Ord : "Ord (list bar)" *)

(** In these cases, it's pretty clear what the problem is.  To fix it,
    we just have to define a new instance.  But in more complex
    situations it can be trickier. *)

(** A few simple tricks can be very helpful:
      - Do [Set Printing Implicit] and then use [Check] and [Print] to
        investigate the types of the things in the expression where
        the error is being reported.
      - Add some [@] annotations and explicitly fill in some of the
        arguments that should be getting instantiated automatically,
        to check your understanding of what they should be getting
        instantiated with.
      - Turn on tracing of instance search with [Set Typeclasses
        Debug.] *)

(** The [Set Typeclasses Debug] command has a variant that causes it
    to print even more information: [Set Typeclasses Debug Verbosity
    2.]  Writing just [Set Typeclasses Debug] is equivalent to [Set
    Typeclasses Debug Verbosity 1.] *)

(** Another potential source of confusion with error messages comes up
if you forget a [`].  For example: *)

Fail Definition max {A: Type} {Ord A} (x y : A) : A :=
  if le x y then y else x.
(* ===>
     The command has indeed failed with message:

      ?X358==[A0 Ord A x y |- Ord A] (parameter Ord of @le) {?Ord}  *)

(** The [UNDEFINED EVARS] here is because the binders that are
    automatically inserted by implicit generalization are missing.*)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Nontermination *)

(** An even more annoying way that typeclass instantiation can go
    wrong is by simply diverging.  Here is a small example of how this
    can happen. *)

(** Declare a typeclass involving two types parameters [A] and [B] --

    [C]: *)

Instance MyMap_trans {A B C : Type} `{MyMap A B} `{MyMap B C} : MyMap A C :=
  { mymap a := mymap (mymap a) }.

(** This does get us from [bool] to [string] automatically: *)

Definition e3 : string := mymap false.
Compute e3.

(** However, although this example seemed to work, we are actually in
    a state of great peril: If we happen to ask for an instance that
    doesn't exist, the search procedure will diverge. *)

(*

(** * Advice from Experts *)

(** In the process of preparing this chapter, we asked people on the
    [coq-club] mailing list for their best tips on preventing and
    debugging typeclass confusions, and on best practices for choosing
    between typeclasses and other large-scale structuring mechanisms
    such as modules and canonical structures.  We received a number of
    generous replies, which we should eventually digest and
    incorporate into the material above.  For the moment, they are
    recorded here essentially as posted (lightly edited for ease of
    reading). *)

(** The fact that typeclass resolution resorts to unrestricted proof
    search is a blessing and a curse for sure. Errors tell you only
    that proof search failed and the initial problem while in general
    you need to look at the trace of resolution steps to figure out
    what's missing or, in the worst case, making search diverge. If
    you are writing obviously recursive instances, not mixing
    computation with the search (e.g. Unfolding happening in the
    indices necessary for instances to match), and not creating
    dependent subgoals then you're basically writing Haskell 98-style
    instances and should get the same "simplicity".

    I think for more elaborate use cases (terms in indices,
    dependencies and computation), when encountering unexpected
    failure the debug output (Set Typeclasses Debug) is
    necessary. Testing the logic program, using Checks for example is
    a good way to explore the proof search results. One can also debug
    interactively by switching to the tactic mode and looking at the
    [typeclasses eauto] behavior. We're facing the same issues as
    logic programming and I don't know of a silver bullet to debug
    these programs.

    For common issues a newcomer is likely to get, there are missing
    instances which can be prevented/tested using some coverage tests,
    divergence which can be understood by looking at the
    trace (usually it's because of a dangerous instance like
    transitivity or symmetry which has to be restricted or removed,
    and sometimes because of a conversion which makes an instance
    always applicable), and ambiguity when the user does not get the
    instance he expected (due to overlapping mainly, priorities can
    help here).

    One advantage of modules (over typeclasses) is that everything is
    explicit but the abstraction cost a bit higher as you usually have
    to functorize whole modules instead of individual functions, and
    often write down signatures separate from the implementations. One
    rule of thumb is that if there are potentially multiple instances
    of the same interface for the same type/index then a module is
    preferable, but adding more indexes to distinguish the instances
    is also possible. *)

(* ================================================================= *)

(** One thing that always gets me is that overlapping instances are 
    easy to write with no warning from Coq (unlike Haskell, which
    ensures that resolution always pick a single instance). This 
    requires me to often use:

   Typeclasses eauto := debug.

   and switch to my *coq* buffer to see which lookup did not resolve to the
   instance I was expecting. This is usually fixed by one of two things:

      - Change the "priority" of the overlapping instance (something we 
        cannot do in Haskell).
      - Change the Instance to a Definition -- which I can still use it as an
        explicitly passed dictionary, but this removes it from resolution.

    Another scenario that often bites me is when I define an instance
    for a type class, and then intend to write a function using the
    type class and forget to provide it as an argument. In Haskell
    this would be an error, but in Coq it just resolves to whatever
    the last globally defined instance was.

    For example, say I write a function that uses a functor, but forget 
    to mention the functor:

   Definition foo (C D : Category) (x y : C) (f : x ~> y) 
              : fobj x ~> fobj y :=
     fmap f.

    In Haskell this gives an error stating that no Functor is
    available. In Coq, it type checks using the highest priority
    [C --> D] functor instance in scope. I typically discover that
    this has happened when I try to use [foo] and find the Functor to
    be too specific, or by turning on Printing All and looking at the
    definition of `foo`. However, there are times when `foo` is deep
    down in an expression, and then it's not obvious *at all* why it's
    failing.

    The other way to solve this is to manually ensure there are no
    Instance definitions that might overlap, such as a generic
    [Instance] for [C --> D], but only instances from specific
    categories to specific categories (though again, I might define
    several functors of that same type). It would be nice if I could
    make this situation into an error.

    Finally, there is the dreaded "diamond problem", when referring to type
    classes as record members rather than type indices:

   Class Foo := {
     method : Type -> Type
   }.

   Class Bar := {
     bar_is_foo :> Foo
   }.

   Class Baz := {
     baz_is_foo :> Foo
   }.

   Class Oops := {
     oops_is_bar :> Bar
     oops_is_baz :> Baz
   }.

    [Oops] refers to two [Foos], and I need explicit evidence to know when 
    they are the same [Foo]. I work around this using indices:

   Class Foo := {
     method : Type -> Type
   }.

   Class Bar (F : Foo) := {
   }.

   Class Baz (F : Foo) := {
   }.

   Class Oops (F : Foo) := {
     oops_is_bar :> Bar F
     oops_is_baz :> Baz F
   }.

    Only those classes which might be multiply-inherited need to be
    lifted like this. It forces me to use Sections to avoid
    repetition, but allows Coq to see that base classes sharing is
    plainly evident.

    The main gotcha here for the newcomer is that it is not obvious at
    all when the diamond problem is what you're facing, since when it
    hits the parameters are hidden indices, and you end up with goals
    like:

   A, B : Type
   F : Foo
   O : Oops
   H : @method (@bar_is_foo (@oops_is_bar O)) A = @method F B
   --------------------
   @method F A = @method F B

    You can't apply here without simplying in H. However, what you see at 
    first is:

   A, B : Type
   F : Foo
   O : Oops
   H : method A = method B
   --------------------
   method A = method B

    As a newcomer, knowing to turn on Printing All is just not obvious
    here, but it quickly becomes something you learn to do whenever
    what looks obvious is not.

    Other than these things, I use type classes heavily in my own
    libraries, and very much enjoy the facility they provide. I have a
    category-theory library that is nearly all type classes, and I ran
    into every one of the problems described above, before learning
    how to "work with Coq" to make things happy. *)

(** What I had most problems with initially is that some type classes
    have implicit parameters. This works quite well when the nesting
    level of these parameters is small, but when the nesting of
    parameters gets deeper one can have the issue that unification
    takes long, that error messages are hard to understand and that
    later in a proof one might require certain relations between
    different parameters of a type class which are not explicit when
    the initial resolution was done and that an instance is chosen
    which is not compatible with these requirements, although there is
    one which would be compatible. The solution is typically to
    explicitly specify some of the implicit parameters, especially
    their relation to each other. Another advantage of stating certain
    things explicitly is that it is easier to understand what actually
    happens. *)

(** Typeclasses are merely about inferring some implicit arguments
    using proof search. The underlying modularity mechanism, which is
    the ability to define "existential types" using induction, was
    _always_ there in Coq: typeclasses merely cuts down on verbosity
    because more arguments can now be implicit because they can be
    automatically inferred.  Relying on proof search often brings
    predictability concerns. So, guidance on taming proof search would
    be very useful: Chapter 13 of Chipala's Certified Programming with
    Dependent Types (CPDT) might be a good background for using
    typeclasses.  Also, it is good to keep in mind that if
    typeclass-resolution fails to instantiate an implicit argument,
    some/all of those arguments can be provided manually. Often, just
    providing one such implicit argument gives enough clues to the
    inference engine to infer all of them. I think it is important to
    emphasize that typeclass arguments are just implicit arguments.

    Also, another design decision in typeclasses/records is whether to
    unbundle.  The following paper makes a great case for unbundling:
    Spitters, Bas, and Eelis Van Der Weegen. “Type Classes for
    Mathematics in Type Theory.” MSCS 21, no. Special Issue 04 (2011):
    795–825. doi:10.1017/S0960129511000119.
    https://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.1323v1.pdf.

    I think the above paper is missing one argument for unbundling:
    I've seen many libraries that begin by making an interface (say I)
    that bundles _all_ the operations (and their correctness
    properties) they will _ever_ need and then _all_ items in the
    library (say L) are parametrized by over I.  A problem with this
    bundled approach is impossible to use _any_ part of D if you are
    missing _any_ operation (or proof of a logical property of the
    operation) in the interface I, even if parts of D don't actually
    need that operation: I've run into situations where it is
    impossible to cook up an operation that 90 percent of L doesn't use
    anyway.  When using the unbundled approach, one can use Coq's
    Section mechanism to ensure that definitions/proofs only depend on
    items of the interface they actually use, and not on a big
    bundle. *)
