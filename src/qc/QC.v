(** * Generators *)

(** The heart of property-based random testing is generation of random
    inputs.  *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The [G] Monad *)

(** In QuickChick, a generator for elements of some type [A] belongs
    to the type [G A].  Intuitively, this type describes functions
    that take a random seed to an element of [A].  We will see below
    that [G] is actually a bit more than this, but this intuition will
    do for now. *)

(** QuickChick provides a number of primitives for building
    generators.  First, [returnGen] takes a constant value and yields
    a generator that always returns this value. *)

Check returnGen. 
(** 

     ===> returnGen : ?A -> G ?A 
*)

(** We can see how it behaves by using the [Sample] command, which
    supplies its generator argument with several different random
    seeds: *)

(* Sample (returnGen 42).

     ===> [42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42] 
*)

(** Next, given a random generator for [A] and a _function_ [f] taking
    an [A] and yielding a random generator for [B], we can plumb the
    two together into a generator for [B] that works by internally
    generating a random [A] and applying [f] to it. *)

Check bindGen.
(**

     ===> bindGen : G ?A -> (?A -> G ?B) -> G ?B 
*) 

(** Naturally, the implementation of [bindGen] must take care
    to pass different random seeds to the two sub-generators! *)

(** With these two primitives in hand, we can make [G] an instance of
    the [Monad] typeclass. *)

Section GMonadDef. 

Instance GMonad : `{Monad G} | 3 :=
  {
    ret := @returnGen;
    bind := @bindGen
  }.

End GMonadDef.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Primitive generators *)

(** QuickChick provides several primitive generators for "ordered
    types," accessed via the [choose] combinator. *)

Check @choose.
(**

     ===> 
     @choose
     : forall A : Type, ChoosableFromInterval A -> A * A -> G A 
*)

(** The [ChoosableFromInterval] typeclass describes primitive types
    [A], like natural numbers and integers ([Z]), for which it makes
    sense to randomly generate elements from a given interval. *)

Print ChoosableFromInterval. 
(**

     ===>
     Record ChoosableFromInterval (A : Type) : Type := 
       Build_ChoosableFromInterval
       { super : Ord A;
         randomR : A * A -> RandomSeed -> A * RandomSeed;
         ...
       }. 
*)

(* Sample (choose (0,10)).

     ===> [ 1, 2, 1, 9, 8, 10, 3, 6, 0, 1, 8 ]
*)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard, optional (cfi)

    Print out the full definition of [ChoosableFromInterval].  Can you
    understand what it means?

    [] *)    

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Lists *)

(** Since they are a very commonly used compound datatype, lists have
    special combinators in QuickChick: [listOf] and [vectorOf]. *)

(** The [listOf] combinator takes as input a generator for elements of
    type [A] and returns a generator for lists of [A]s. *)

Check listOf.
(**

     ===> listOf : G ?A -> G (list ?A) 
*)

(* Sample (listOf (choose (0,4))).

     ===> 
      [ [ 0, 3, 2, 0 ], 
        [ 1, 3, 4, 1, 0, 3, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 0, 4, 2, 3, 0, 1 ], 
        [ 3, 4, 3, 1, 2, 4, 4, 1, 0, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2, 4, 4, 1 ], 
        [ 0 ], 
        [ 4, 2, 3 ], 
        [ 3, 3, 4, 0, 1, 4, 3, 2, 4, 1 ], 
        [ 0, 4 ], 
        [  ], 
        [ 1, 0, 1, 3, 1 ], 
        [ 0, 0 ], 
        [ 1, 4 ], 
        [ 4, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0 ], 
        [ 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 4 ], 
        [ 2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 3 ], 
        [ 4, 3, 3, 0, 1 ], 
        [ 3, 3, 3 ], 
        [ 3, 2, 4 ], 
        [ 1, 2 ], 
        [  ], 
        [  ] ] 
*)

(** The second combinator, [vectorOf], receives an additional numeric
    argument [n], the length of the list to be generated. *)

Check vectorOf.
(**

     ===> vectorOf : nat -> G ?A -> G (list ?A) 
*)

(* Sample (vectorOf 3 (choose (0,4))).

     ===> 
      [ [0, 1, 4], 
        [1, 1, 0], 
        [3, 3, 3], 
        [0, 2, 1], 
        [1, 3, 2], 
        [3, 3, 0], 
        [3, 0, 4], 
        [2, 3, 3], 
        [3, 2, 4], 
        [1, 2, 3], 
        [2, 0, 4]  ] 
*)

(** This raises a question.  It's clear how [vectorOf] decides how big
    to make its lists (we tell it!), but how does [listOf] do it?  The
    answer is hidden inside [G].
  
    In addition to handling random-seed plumbing, the [G] monad also
    maintains a "current maximum size" (in the style of a "reader
    monad", if you like that terminology): a natural number that
    can be used as an upper bound on the depth of generated objects. *)

(** Internally, [G A] is just a synonym for [nat -> RandomSeed -> A]. *)

Module DefineG.

Inductive G (A:Type) : Type :=
| MkG : (nat -> RandomSeed -> A) -> G A.
Arguments MkG {A}.

End DefineG.

(** When it is searching for counterexamples, QuickChick progressively
    tries larger and larger values for the size bound [n], to
    gradually explore deeper into the search space.

    Each generator can choose to interpret the size bound however it
    wants, and there is no _enforced_ guarantee that generators pay
    any attention to it at all; however, it is good practice to
    respect this bound when programming generators. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Custom Generators *)

(** Naturally, we also need generators for user-defined datatypes.
    Here's a simple one to play with: *)

Inductive color := Red | Green | Blue | Yellow.

(** In order for commands like [Sample] to display colors, we should
    make [color] an instance of the [Show] typeclass: *)

Instance show_color : Show color :=
  {| show c :=
       match c with
         | Red    => "Red"
         | Green  => "Green"
         | Blue   => "Blue"
         | Yellow => "Yellow"
       end
  |}.

(** To generate a random color, we just need to pick one of the
    constructors [Red], [Green], [Blue], or [Yellow]. This is done
    using [elems_]. *)

Check elems_.
(**

     ===> elems_ : ?A -> list ?A -> G ?A 
*)

Definition genColor' : G color :=
  elems_ Red [ Red ; Green ; Blue ; Yellow ].

(* Sample genColor'.

     ===> 
   [Red, Green, Blue, Blue, Red, Yellow, Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Red] 
*)

(** The first argument to [elems_] serves as a default result.  If
    its list argument is not empty, [elems_] returns a generator
    that always picks an element of that list; otherwise the generator
    always returns the default object.  This makes Coq's totality
    checker happy, but makes [elem_] a little awkward to use, since
    typically its second argument will be a non-empty constant list. *)

(** To make the common case smoother, QuickChick provides convenient
    notations that automatically extract the default element. *)

(** 

     " 'elems' [ x ] " 
         := elems_ x (cons x nil)
     " 'elems' [ x ; y ] " 
         := elems_ x (cons x (cons y nil))
     " 'elems' [ x ; y ; .. ; z ] " 
         := elems_ x (cons x (cons y (.. (cons z nil))))
     " 'elems' ( x ;; l ) " 
         := elems_ x (cons x l)
*)

(** Armed with [elems], we can write a [color] generator the way we'd
    hope. *)

Definition genColor : G color :=
  elems [ Red ; Green ; Blue ; Yellow ].

(* Sample genColor.

     ===> [Red, Green, Blue, Blue, Red, Yellow, Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Red] 
*)

(** For more complicated ADTs, QuickChick provides more combinators.

    We showcase these using everyone's favorite datatype: trees! *)

(** Our trees are standard polymorphic binary trees; either [Leaf]s or
    [Node]s containing some payload of type [A] and two subtrees. *)

Inductive Tree A :=
| Leaf : Tree A
| Node : A -> Tree A -> Tree A -> Tree A.

Arguments Leaf {A}.
Arguments Node {A} _ _ _.

(** Before getting to generators for trees, we again give a
    straightforward [Show] instance.  (The need for a local [let fix]
    declaration stems from the fact that Coq's typeclasses, unlike
    Haskell's, are not automatically recursive.  We could
    alternatively define [aux] with a separate top-level
    [Fixpoint].) *) 

Instance showTree {A} `{_ : Show A} : Show (Tree A) :=
  {| show := let fix aux t :=
       match t with
         | Leaf => "Leaf"
         | Node x l r =>
             "Node (" ++ show x ++ ") (" 
                      ++ aux l ++ ") (" 
                      ++ aux r ++ ")"
       end
     in aux
  |}.

(** This brings us to our first generator _combinator_, called [oneOf_]. *)

Check oneOf_.
(**

     ===> oneOf_ : G ?A -> list (G ?A) -> G ?A 
*)

(** This combinator takes a default generator and a list of
    generators, and it picks one of the generators from the list
    uniformly at random (unless the list is empty, in which case it
    picks from the default generator).  As with [elems_], QuickChick
    introduces a more convenient notation [oneOf] to hide this default
    element. *)

(** Next, Coq's termination checker will save us from shooting
    ourselves in the foot!

    The "obvious" first attempt at a generator is the following
    function [genTree], which generates either a [Leaf] or else a
    [Node] whose subtrees are generated recursively (and whose payload
    is produced by a generator [g] for elements of type [A]).*)

(**

     Fixpoint genTree {A} (g : G A) : G (Tree A) :=
        oneOf [ ret Leaf ;;
                liftM3 Node g (genTree g) (genTree g) ].
*)

(** Of course, this fixpoint will not pass Coq's termination
    checker. Attempting to justify this fixpoint informally, one might
    first say that at some point the random generation will pick a
    [Leaf] so it will eventually terminate.  But the termination
    checker cannot understand this kind of probabilistic reasoning.
    Moreover, even informally, the reasoning is wrong: Every time we
    choose to generate a [Node], we create two separate branches that
    must both be terminated with leaves.  It is not hard to show that
    the _expected_ size of the generated trees is actually
    infinite! *)

(** The solution is to use the standard "fuel" idiom that Coq users
    are familiar with.  We add a natural number [sz] as a parameter.  We
    decrease this size in each recursive call, and when it reaches
    [O], we always generate [Leaf].  Thus, the initial [sz] parameter
    serves as a bound on the depth of the tree. *)

Fixpoint genTreeSized {A} (sz : nat) (g : G A) : G (Tree A) :=
  match sz with
    | O => ret Leaf
    | S sz' =>
        oneOf [ 
          ret Leaf ;
          liftM3 Node g (genTreeSized sz' g) (genTreeSized sz' g)
        ]
  end.

(* Sample (genTreeSized 3 (choose(0,3))).

(** While this generator succeeds in avoiding nontermination, we can
    see just by observing the result of [Sample] that there is a
    problem: it produces way too many [Leaf]s!  This is actually not
    surprising, since half the time we generate a [Leaf] right at the
    outset.  *)

(** We can obtain bigger trees more often if we skew the distribution
    towards [Node]s using a more expressive QuickChick combinator,
    [freq_]. *)

Check freq_.
(**

     ===> freq_ : G ?A -> seq (nat * G ?A) -> G ?A 
*)

(** As with [oneOf], we usually use a convenient derived notation,
    called [freq], that takes a list of generators, each tagged with a
    natural number that serves as the weight of that generator.  For
    example, in the following generator, a [Leaf] will be generated 1
    / (sz + 1) of the time and a [Node] the remaining sz / (sz + 1) of
    the time. *)

    tree -- swapping its left and right subtrees recursively. *)
   
Fixpoint mirror {A : Type} (t : Tree A) : Tree A :=
  match t with
    | Leaf => Leaf
    | Node x l r => Node x (mirror r) (mirror l)

(** Now we want to use our generator to create a lot of random trees
    and, for each one, check whether [mirrorP] returns [true] or
    [false].

    Another way to say this is that we want to use [mirrorP] to build
    a _generator for test results_.

    Let's see how this works. *)

(** (Let's open a playground module so we can show simplified
    versions of the actual QuickChick definitions.) *)

Module CheckerPlayground1.

(** First, we need a type of test results -- let's call it [Result].
    For the moment, think of [Result] as just an enumerated type with
    constructors [Success] and [Failure].  *)

Inductive Result := Success | Failure.

Instance showResult : Show Result :=
  {
    show r := match r with Success => "Success" | Failure => "Failure" end
  }.

(** Then we can define the type [Checker] to be [G Result]. *)

Definition Checker := G Result.

(** That is, a [Checker] embodies some way of performing a randomized
    test of the truth of some proposition, which, when applied to a
    random seed, will yield either [Success] (meaning that the
    proposition survived this test) or [Failure] (meaning that this
    test demonstrates that the proposition was false).

    Sampling a [Checker] many times with different seeds will cause
    many different tests to be performed. *)

(** To check [mirrorP], we'll need a way to build a [Checker] out of a
    function from trees to booleans.

    Actually, we will be wanting to build [Checker]s based on many
    different types.  So let's begin by defining a typeclass
    [Checkable], where an instance for [Checkable A] will provide a
    way of converting an [A] into a [Checker]. *)

Class Checkable A :=
  {
    checker : A -> Checker
  }.

(** It is easy to give a [bool] instance for [Checkable]. *)

Instance checkableBool : Checkable bool :=
  {
    checker b := if b then ret Success else ret Failure
  }.

(** That is, the boolean value [true] passes every test we might
    subject it to (i.e., the result of [checker] is a [G] that returns
    [true] for every seed), while [false] fails all tests. *)

(** Let's see what happens if we sample checkers for our favorite
    booleans, [true] and [false].  *)

(** (We need to exit the playground so that we can do [Sample]:
    because [Sample] is implemented internally via extraction to
    OCaml, which usually does not work from inside a [Module].) *)

    checkers always generate the same results.  We'll make things more
    interesting in a bit, but first let's pause to define one more

    We have seen that the result of [mirrorP] is [Checkable].  What we

    This is where _shrinking_ comes in. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Shrinking *)

(** Shrinking (sometimes known as "delta debugging") is a process
    that, given a counterexample to some property, searches (greedily)
    for smaller counterexamples.

    Given a shrinking function [s] of type [A -> list A] and a value
    [x] of type [A] that is known to falsify some property [P],
    QuickChick tries [P] on all members of [s x] until it finds
    another counterexample.  It repeats this process, starting from
    the new counterexample, until it reaches a point where [x] fails
    property [P] but every element of [s x] succeeds.  This [x] is a
    "locally minimal" counterexample. *)

(** Clearly, this greedy algorithm only work if all elements of
    [s x] are strictly "smaller" than [x] for all [x] -- that is,
    there should be some total order on the type of [x] such that [s]
    is strictly decreasing in this order.  This is the basic
    correctness requirement for a shrinker.  It is guaranteed by all
    the shrinkers that QuickChick derives automatically, but ifyou
    roll your own shrinkers you need to be careful to maintain it. *)

(** Here is a shrinker for [color]s. *)

Instance shrinkColor : Shrink color :=
  {
    shrink c :=
      match c with
      | Red => [ ]
      | Green => [ Red ]
      | Blue => [ Red; Green ]
      | Yellow => [ Red; Green; Blue ]
      end
  }.

(** Most of the time, shrinking functions should try to return
    elements that are "just one step" smaller than the one they are
    given. For example, consider the default shrinking function for
    lists provided by QuickChick. *)

Print shrinkList.
(**

     ===> 
       shrinkList = 
         fun (A : Type) (H : Shrink A) => 
            {| shrink := shrinkListAux shrink |}
       : forall A : Type, Shrink A -> Shrink (list A) 

*)

Print shrinkListAux.
(**

     ===> 
       shrinkListAux = 
         fix shrinkListAux (A : Type) (shr : A -> list A) (l : list A) :
           list (list A) :=
           match l with
           | [] => []
           | x :: xs =>
               ((xs :: map (fun xs' : list A => x :: xs') 
                           (shrinkListAux A shr xs)) ++
                map (fun x' : A => x' :: xs) (shr x))
           end
       : forall A : Type, (A -> list A) -> list A -> list (list A) 
*)

(** An empty list cannot be shrunk, as there is no smaller list.  A
    cons cell can be shrunk in three ways: by returning the tail of
    the list, by shrinking the tail of the list and keeping the same
    head, or by shrinking the head and keeping the same tail. By
    induction, this process can generate all smaller lists.

    (Pro tip: One refinement to the advice that shrinkers should
    return "one step smaller" values is that, for potentially large
    data structures, it can sometimes greatly improve performance if a
    shrinker returns not only all the "slightly smaller" structures
    but also one or two "much smaller" structures.  E.g. for a number
    [x] greater than [2], we might shrink to [0; x div 2; pred x].) *)

(** Writing a shrinking instance for trees is equally straightforward:
    we don't shrink [Leaf]s, while for [Node]s we can either return
    the left or right subtree, or shrink the payload, or shrink one of
    the subtrees. *)

(** * Dealing with Preconditions *)

(** A large class of properties that are commonly encountered in
    property-based testing are _properties with preconditions_.  The
    default QuickChick approach of generating inputs based on type
    information can be inefficient for such properties, especially for
    those with sparse preconditions (i.e. ones that are satisfied
    rarely with respect to their input domain). *)

Open Scope bool.

(** Consider a function that inserts a natural number into a sorted list. *)

Fixpoint sorted (l : list nat) := 
  match l with 
  | [] => true 
  | x::xs => match xs with 
             | [] => true 
             | y :: ys => (x <=? y) && (sorted xs) 
             end 
  end.

Fixpoint insert (x : nat) (l : list nat) := 
  match l with 
  | [] => [x] 
  | y::ys => if x <=? y then x :: l 
             else y :: insert x ys 
  end.

(** We could test [insert] using the following _conditional_ property: *)

Definition insert_spec (x : nat) (l : list nat) :=
  sorted l ==> sorted (insert x l).

Definition test_insert_spec :=
  forAll (choose (0,10)) (fun x =>
  forAll (listOf (choose (0,10))) (fun l =>                            
  insert_spec x l)).

(** To test this property, QuickChick will try to generate random
    integers [x] and lists [l], _check_ whether the generated [l] is
    sorted, and, if it is, proceed to check the conclusion. If it is
    not, it will discard the generated inputs and try again.

    As we can see, this can lead to many discarded tests (in this
    case, about twice as many as successful ones), which wastes a
    lot of CPU and leads to inefficient testing. *)

(** But the wasted effort is the least of our problems! Let's take a
    peek at the distribution of the lengths of generated lists using
    [collect]. *)

Definition insert_spec' (x : nat) (l : list nat) :=
  collect (List.length l) (insert_spec x l).

(** The vast majority of inputs have length 2 or less, while the larger
    lists are almost always discarded!

    (This explains something you might have found suspicious in the
    previous statistics: that 1/3 of the randomly generated lists were
    already sorted!) *)

(** When dealing with properties with preconditions, it is common
    practice to write custom generators for well-distributed random
    data that satisfy the property. *)

(** For example, we can generate sorted lists with elements between
    [low] and [high] like this... *)

Fixpoint genSortedList (low high : nat) (size : nat)

                    xs <- genSortedList x high size';; 
                    ret (x :: xs)) ] end.

(** We use a [size] parameter as usual to control the length of generated
    lists. *)

(** If [size] is zero, we can only return the empty list which
    is always sorted. If [size] is nonzero, we need to perform an
    additional check whether [high] is less than [low] (in which case
    we also return the empty list).  If it is not, we can proceed to
    choose to generate a cons cell, with its head generated between
    [low] and [high] and its tail generated recursively. *)

(* Sample (genSortedList 0 10 10). *)

(** Finally, we can use [forAllShrink] to define a property using the
    new generator: *)

Definition insert_spec_sorted (x : nat) :=
  forAllShrink 
    (genSortedList 0 10 10) 
    shrink 
    (fun l => insert_spec' x l).

(** ** Another Precondition: Binary Search Trees *)
