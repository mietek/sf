(** Having covered the basics of QuickChick in the previous
    chapter, we are ready to dive into a more realistic case study: a
    typed variant of Imp, the simple imperative language introduced in
    _Logical Foundations_.

    The version of Imp presented there enforces a syntactic separation
    between boolean and arithmetic expressions: [bexp] just ranges
    over boolean expressions, while [aexp] ranges over arithmetic
    ones.  Moreover, variables are only allowed in [aexp] and hence
    only take numeric values.  By contrast, in _Typed Imp_ (TImp) we
    collapse the expression syntax and allow variables to range over
    both numbers and booleans. With the unified syntax, we introduce
    the notion of _well-typed_ Imp expressions and programs (where
    every variable only ranges over values of a single type throughout
    the whole program).  We then give an operational semantics to TImp
    in the form of a (partial) evaluation function -- partial since,
    in the unified syntax, we can write nonsensical expressions such
    as [0 + True].

    A common mantra in functional programming is "well-typed programs
    cannot go wrong," and TImp is no exception. The _soundness_
    property for TImp will state that evaluating well-typed
    expressions and programs always succeeds.

    From the point of view of testing, soundness is interesting
    because it is a _conditional_ property. As we saw in the previous
    chapter, testing such properties effectively requires custom
    generators.  In this chapter, we show how to scale the techniques
    for writing generators explained in [QC] to more realistic
    generators for well-typed expressions and programs. In addition,
    we dicuss the need for custom shrinkers preserving invariants, a
    problem dual to that of custom generators. *)

(** * Identifiers, Types and Contexts *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Identifiers *)

(** For the type of identifiers of TImp we will use a wrapper around 
    plain natural numbers. *)

Inductive id :=
|  Id : nat -> id.

(** We will need one identifier-specific operation, [fresh]: given any
    finite set of identifiers, we can produce one that is distinct
    from all other identifiers in the set.
   
    To compute a fresh [id] given a list of [id]s we can just produce
    the number that is 1 larger than the maximum element: *)

Fixpoint max_elt (al:list id) : nat :=
  match al with
  | nil => 0 
  | (Id n')::al' => max n' (max_elt al')
  end.

Definition fresh (al:list id) : id :=
  Id (S (max_elt al)).

(** We will also need a way of testing for equality, which we can 
    derive with the standard [dec_eq] tactic. *)
Instance eq_id_dec (x1 x2 : id) : Dec (x1 = x2).
Proof. dec_eq. Defined.

(** One advantage of using natural numbers as identifiers is that 
    we can take advantage of the [Show] instance of [nat] to print 
    them. *)

Instance show_id : Show id :=
  { show x := let '(Id n) := x in show n }.

(** To generate identifiers for TImp, we will not just generate
    arbitrary natural numbers. More often than not, we will need to
    generate a set of identifiers, or pick an identifier from such a
    set. If we represent a set as a list, we can do the former with a
    recursive function that generates [n] fresh [nat]s starting from
    the empty list. For the latter, we have QuickChick's [elems_]
    combinator. *)

Fixpoint get_fresh_ids n l :=
  match n with
  | 0 => l
  | S n' => get_fresh_ids n' ((fresh l) :: l)
  end.

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard (genId)

    Write a [Gen] instance for [id] using the [elems_]
    combinator and [get_fresh_ids].  *)

(* FILL IN HERE *)   
(** [] *)

(** There remains the question of how to [shrink] [id]s. 
    We will answer that question when [id]s are used later 
    in the chapter. For now, let's leave the [Shrink] instance
    as a no-op.
 *)
Instance shrinkId : Shrink id :=
  { shrink x := [] }.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Types *)

(** Here is the type of TImp types: *)

Inductive ty := TBool | TNat. 

(** That is, TImp has two kinds of values: booleans and natural
    numbers. *)

(** To use [ty] in testing, we will need [Arbitrary], [Show], and
    [Dec] instances. *)

(** In QC.v, we saw how to write such generators by hand.
    We also saw, however, that this process can largely be automated
    for simple inductive types (like [ty], [nat], [list], [tree], etc.).
    QuickChick provides a top-level vernacular command to derive such
    instances. *)

Derive (Arbitrary, Show) for ty.
(* ==>
    GenSizedty is defined

*)

Check GenSizedty.
(* ==> GenSizedty : GenSized ty *)
Check Shrinkty.
(* ==> Shrinkty  : Shrink ty   *)
Check Showty.
(* ==> Showty : Show ty     *)

(** Decidable equality instances are not yet derived fully
    automatically by QuickChick.  However, the boilerplate we have to
    write is largely straightforward. As we saw in the previous
    chapters, [Dec] is a typeclass wrapper around ssreflect's
    [decidable] and we can use the [dec_eq] tactic to automate 
    the process. *)

Instance eq_dec_ty (x y : ty) : Dec (x = y).
Proof. dec_eq. Defined.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** List-Based Maps *)

(** To encode typing environments (and, later on, states), we will
    need maps from identifiers to values. However, the function-based
    representation in the _Software Foundations_ version of Imp is not
    well suited for testing: we need to be able to access the domain
    of the map, fold over it, and test for equality; these are all
    awkward to define for Coq functions. Therefore, we introduce a
    simple list-based map representation that uses [id]s as the keys.

    The operations we need are:
       - [empty] : To create the empty map.
       - [get] : To look up the binding of an element, if any.
       - [set] : To update the binding of an element.
       - [dom] : To get the list of keys in the map. *)

    

(** The implementation of a map is a simple association list.  If a
    list contains multiple tuples with the same key, then the binding
    of the key in the map is the one that appears first in the list;
    that is, later bindings can be shadowed. *)

Definition Map A := list (id * A).

(** The [empty] map is the empty list. *)

Definition map_empty {A} : Map A := [].

(** To [get] the binding of an identifier [x], we just need to walk 
    through the list and find the first [cons] cell where the key 
    is equal to [x], if any. *)

Fixpoint map_get {A} (m : Map A) x : option A :=
  match m with
  | [] => None
  | (k, v) :: m' => if x = k ? then Some v else map_get m' x
  end.

(** To [set] the binding of an identifier, we just need to [cons] 
    it at the front of the list. *) 

Definition map_set {A} (m:Map A) (x:id) (v:A) : Map A := (x, v) :: m.

(** Finally, the domain of a map is just the set of its keys. *)
Fixpoint map_dom {A} (m:Map A) : list id :=
  match m with
  | [] => []
  | (k', v) :: m' => k' :: map_dom m'
  end.

(** We next introduce a simple inductive relation, [bound_to m x a], that 
    holds precisely when the binding of some identifier [x] is equal to [a] in 
    [m] *)

Inductive bound_to {A} : Map A -> id -> A -> Prop :=
  | Bind : forall x m a, map_get m x = Some a -> bound_to m x a.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Deciding [bound_to] (optional) *)

(** We can now decide whether [bound_to m x a] holds for a given
    arrangement of [m], [x] and [a].  On a first reading, you may
    prefer to skip the next few paragraphs (until the start of the
    [Context] subsection), which deal with partially automating the
    proofs for such instances. *)

Instance dec_bound_to {A : Type} Gamma x (T : A) 
         `{D : forall (x y : A), Dec (x = y)} 
          : Dec (bound_to Gamma x T).
Proof. 
  constructor. unfold ssrbool.decidable. 
  destruct (map_get Gamma x) eqn:Get.
      
(** After unfolding [decidable] and destructing [map_get Gamma x], we are
    left with two subgoals. In the first, we know that [map_get Gamma x =
    Some a] and effectively want to decide whether [map_get Gamma x = Some
    T] or not. Which means we need to decide whether [a = T]. Thankfully,
    we can decide that using our hypothesis [D]. *)

(** At this point, the first goal can be immediately decided positevely
    using constructor. *)

    + left. constructor. auto.

(** In the second subgoal, we can show that [bound_to] doesn't hold. *)

    + right; intro Contra; inversion Contra; subst; clear Contra.
      congruence.

(** Both of these tactic patterns are very common in non-trival [Dec] 
    instances. It is worth we automating them a bit using LTac. *)

Abort.

(** A lot of the time, we can immediately decide a property positivly 
    using constructor applications. That is captured in [solve_left]. *)

Ltac solve_left  := try solve [left; econstructor; eauto].

(** Much of the time, we can also immediately decide that a property
    _doesn't_ hold by assuming it, doing inversion, and using
    [congruence]. *)

Ltac solve_right := 
  let Contra := fresh "Contra" in
  try solve [right; intro Contra; inversion Contra; subst; 
             clear Contra; eauto; congruence].

(** We group both in a single tactic, which does nothing at all if 
    it fails to solve a goal, thanks to [try solve]. *)

Ltac solve_sum := solve_left; solve_right.

(** We can now prove the [Dec] instance quite concisely. *)

Instance dec_bound_to {A : Type} Gamma x (T : A) 
         `{D : forall (x y : A), Dec (x = y)}
  : Dec (bound_to Gamma x T).
Proof. 
  constructor. unfold ssrbool.decidable. 
  destruct (map_get Gamma x) eqn:Get; solve_sum.
  destruct (D a T) as [[Eq | NEq]]; subst; solve_sum.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Contexts *)

(** Typing contexts in TImp are just maps from identifiers to types. *)

Definition context := Map ty.

(** Given a context [Gamma] and a type [T], we can try to generate a
    random [identifier] whose binding in [Gamma] is [T].

    We use [List.filter] to extract all of the elements in [Gamma]
    whose type is equal to [T] and then, for each [(a,T')] that
    remains, return the name [a]. We use the [oneOf_] combinator to
    pick an generator from this list at random.
    
    Since the filtered list might be empty we return an [option],
    we use [ret None] as the default element for [oneOf_].
 *)

Definition gen_typed_id_from_context (Gamma : context) (T : ty)
            : G (option id) :=
  oneOf_ (ret None) 
         (List.map (fun '(x,T') => ret (Some x))
                   (List.filter (fun '(x,T') => T = T'?) Gamma)).

(** We also need to generate typing contexts. *)

(** Given some natural number [n] to serve as the size of the context,
    we first create its domain, [n] fresh identifiers.  We then create [n]
    arbitrary types with [vectorOf], using the [Gen] instance for [ty]
    we derived earlier.  Finally, we zip ([List.combine]) the domain
    with the ranges which creates the (list-based) map.
*)

Definition gen_context (n : nat) : G context := 
  let domain := get_fresh_ids n [] in
  range <- vectorOf n arbitrary ;;
  ret (List.combine domain range).

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Expressions *)

(** We are now ready to introduce the syntax of expressions in TImp.
    The original Imp had two distinct types of expressions,
    arithmetic and boolean expressions; variables were only
    allowed to range over natural numbers. In TImp, we extend
    variables to range over boolean values as well, and we collapse
    expressions into a single type [exp]. *)

Inductive exp : Type :=
  | EVar : id -> exp
  | ENum : nat -> exp
  | EPlus : exp -> exp -> exp
  | EMinus : exp -> exp -> exp
  | EMult : exp -> exp -> exp
  | ETrue : exp
  | EFalse : exp
  | EEq : exp -> exp -> exp
  | ELe : exp -> exp -> exp
  | ENot : exp -> exp
  | EAnd : exp -> exp -> exp.

(** To print expressions we derive a [Show] Instance. *)

Derive Show for exp.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Typed Expressions *)

(** The following inductive relation characterizes well-typed
    expressions of a particular type. It is straightforward, using
    [bound_to] to access the typing context in the variable case *)

Reserved Notation "Gamma '||-' e '\IN' T" (at level 40).

Inductive has_type : context -> exp -> ty -> Prop := 
| Ty_Var : forall x T Gamma, 
    bound_to Gamma x T -> Gamma ||- EVar x \IN T
| Ty_Num : forall Gamma n, 
    Gamma ||- ENum n \IN TNat
| Ty_Plus : forall Gamma e1 e2, 
    Gamma ||- e1 \IN TNat -> Gamma ||- e2 \IN TNat ->
    Gamma ||- EPlus e1 e2 \IN TNat                                    
| Ty_Minus : forall Gamma e1 e2, 
    Gamma ||- e1 \IN TNat -> Gamma ||- e2 \IN TNat ->
    Gamma ||- EMinus e1 e2 \IN TNat                                    
| Ty_Mult : forall Gamma e1 e2, 
    Gamma ||- e1 \IN TNat -> Gamma ||- e2 \IN TNat ->
    Gamma ||- EMult e1 e2 \IN TNat                                    
| Ty_True : forall Gamma, Gamma ||- ETrue \IN TBool
| Ty_False : forall Gamma, Gamma ||- EFalse \IN TBool
| Ty_Eq : forall Gamma e1 e2, 
    Gamma ||- e1 \IN TNat -> Gamma ||- e2 \IN TNat ->
    Gamma ||- EEq e1 e2 \IN TBool
| Ty_Le : forall Gamma e1 e2,

| Ty_And : forall Gamma e1 e2, 
    Gamma ||- e1 \IN TBool -> Gamma ||- e2 \IN TBool ->
    Gamma ||- EAnd e1 e2 \IN TBool

where "Gamma '||-' e '\IN' T" := (has_type Gamma e T).

(** While the typing relation is almost entirely standard, there is a 
    choice to make about the [Ty_Eq] rule. The [Ty_Eq] constructor
    above requires that the arguments to an equality check are both 
    arithmetic expressions (just like it was in Imp), which simplifies
    some of the discussion in the remainder of the chapter. We could
    have allowed for equality checks between booleans as well - that will
    become an exercise at the end of this chapter. *)

(** Once again, we need a decidable instance for the typing relation of
    TImp. You can skip to the next exercise if you are not interested in
    specific proof details. *)

(** We will need a bit more automation for this proof. We will
    have a lot of hypotheses of the form: 

   IH : forall (T : ty) (Gamma : context),
          ssrbool.decidable (Gamma ||- e1 \IN T)

 
    Using a brute-force approach, we instantiate such [IH]
    with both [TNat] and [TBool], destruct them and then 
    call [solve_sum]. 
     
    The [pose proof] tactic introduces a new hypothesis 
    in our context, while [clear IH] removes it so that 
    we don't try the same instantiations again and 
    again.
*)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (arbitraryExp)

    Derive [Arbitrary] for expressions.  To see how good it is at
    generating _well-typed_ expressions, write a conditional property 
    [cond_prop] that is (trivially) always true, with the precondition 
    that some expression is well-typed. Try to check that property like 
    this:

    QuickChickWith (updMaxSize stdArgs 3) cond_prop.

    This idiom sets the maximum-size parameter for all generators to
    [3], rather the default, which is something larger like 10.  When
    generating examples, QuickChick will start with size 0, gradually
    increase the size until the maximum size is reached, and then
    start over.  What happens when you vary the size bound? *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Generating Typed Expressions *)

(** Instead of generating expressions and filtering them using
    [has_type], we can be smarter and generate _well-typed_
    expressions for a given context directly.

    It is common for conditional generators to return [option]s,
    allowing the possibility of failure if a wrong choice is made
    internally. For example, if we wanted to generate an expression of
    type [TNat] and chose to try to do so by generating a variable,
    then we might not be able to finish (if the context is empty or
    only binds booleans). *)

(** To chain together two generators with types of the form 
    [G (option ...)], we need to execute the first generator, match 
    on its result, and, when it is a [Some], apply the second generator. *)

Definition bindGenOpt {A B : Type} 
             (gma : G (option A)) (k : A -> G (option B))
           : G (option B) :=
  ma <- gma ;;
  match ma with 
  | Some a => k a 
  | None => ret None
  end.

(** This pattern is common enough that QuickChick introduces explicit monadic 
    notations. *)

Print GOpt.
(** 
    GOpt = fun A : Type => G (option A)
         : Type -> Type
*)

Check Monad_GOpt. 
(** 
    Monad_GOpt
         : Monad GOpt
*)

(** This brings us to our first interesting generator -- one for typed
    expressions.  We assume that [Gamma] and [T] are inputs to the
    generation process.  We also use a [size] parameter to control the
    depth of generated expressions (i.e., we'll define a sized
    generator). *)

(** Let's start with a much smaller relation: [has_type_1] (which
    consists of just the first constructor of [has_type]), to
    demonstrate how to build up complex generators for typed
    expressions from smaller parts. *)

Module TypePlayground1.

Inductive has_type : context -> exp -> ty -> Prop := 
  | Ty_Var : forall x T Gamma, 
      bound_to Gamma x T -> has_type Gamma (EVar x) T.

End TypePlayground1.

(** To generate [e] such that [has_type Gamma e T] holds, we need to
    pick one of its constructors (there is only one choice, here) and
    then try to satisfy its preconditions by generating more things.
    To satisfy [Ty_Var] (given [Gamma] and [T]), we need to generate
    [x] such that [bound_to Gamma x T]. But we already have such a
    generator!  We just need to wrap it in an [EVar].  *)

Definition gen_typed_evar (Gamma : context) (T : ty) : GOpt exp :=
  x <- gen_typed_id_from_context Gamma T;;
  ret (EVar x).

(** (Note that this is the [ret] of the [GOpt] monad.) *)

(** Now let's consider an extended typing relation, extending the 
    previous one with all of the constructors of [has_type] that do
    not recursively require [has_type] as a side-condition. These will
    be the _base cases_ for our final generator. *)

| Ty_True : forall Gamma, has_type Gamma ETrue TBool
| Ty_False : forall Gamma, has_type Gamma EFalse TBool.

End TypePlayground2.

(** We can already generate values satisfying [Ty_Var] using
    [gen_typed_evar].  For the rest of the rules, we will need to
    pattern match on the input [T], since [Ty_Num] can only be used if
    [T = TNat], while [Ty_True] and [Ty_False] can only be used if [T
    = TBool].  *)

(** We now need to go from a list of (optional) generators to a 
    single generator. We could do that using the [oneOf] combinator (which
    chooses uniformly), or the [freq] combinator (by adding weights).

    Instead, we introduce a new one, called [backtrack]:

       backtrack : list (nat * GOpt ?A) -> GOpt ?A
*)

(** Just like [freq], [backtrack] selects one of the generators
    according to the input weights. Unlike [freq], if the chosen
    generator fails (i.e. produces [None]), [backtrack] will discard
    it, choose another, and keep going until one succeeds or all
    possibilities are exhausted. Our base-case generator could then be
    like this: *)

(** Typing derivations involving [EPlus] nodes are binary trees, so we
    need to add a [size] parameter to enforce termination. The base
    case ([Ty_Var3]) is handled using [gen_typed_evar] just like

    [Ty_Var3] and trying to generate [Ty_Plus3]. For the latter, the
    input type [T] must be [TNat], otherwise it is not
    applicable. Once again, this leads to a match on [T]: *)

(** The expression shrank to something ill-typed! Since it causes the
    checker to fail, QuickChick views this as a succesfull shrink, even 
    though this could not actually be produced by our generator and 
    doesn't satisfy our preconditions!  One solution would be to check 
    the preconditions in the Checker, filtering out shrinks.  But that 
    would be inefficient. *)

(** We not only need to shrink expressions, we need to shrink them so
    that their type is preserved! To accomplish this, we need to
    intuitively follow the opposite of the procedure we did for
    generators: look at a typing derivation and see what parts of it
    we can shrink to while maintaining their types so that the type of
    the entire thing is preserved.
  
    As in the case of [gen_exp_typed], we are going to build up the
    full shrinker in steps. Let's begin with shrinking constants.

    - If [e = ENum x] for some [x], all we can do is try to shrink
      [x].
    - If [e = ETrue] or [e = EFalse], we could shrink it to the other.
      But remember, we don't want to do both, as this would lead to an
      infinite loop in shrinking!  We choose to shrink [EFalse] to
      [ETrue]. *)

Definition shrink_base (e : exp) : list exp :=
  match e with 
  | ENum n => map ENum (shrink n)
  | ETrue => []
  | EFalse => [ETrue] 
  | _ => []
  end.

(** The next case, [EVar], must take the type [T] to be preserved into
    account. To shrink an [EVar] we could try shrinking the inner
    identifier, but shrinking an identifier by shrinking its natural
    number representation makes little sense. Better, we can try to 
    shrink the [EVar] to a constant of the appropriate type. *)

Definition shrink_evar (T : ty) (e : exp) : list exp :=
  match e with 
  | EVar x => 
    match T with 
    | TNat => [ENum 0]
    | TBool => [ETrue ; EFalse]
    end
  | _ => []
  end.

(** Finally, we need to be able to shrink the recursive cases. Consider 
    [EPlus e1 e2]: 
      - We could try (recursively) shrinking [e1] or [e2] preserving their 
        [TNat] type.
      - We could try to shrink directly to [e1] or [e2] since their type 
        is the same as [EPlus e1 e2]. *)

(** On the other hand, consider [EEq e1 e2]:
      - Again, we could recursively shrink [e1] or [e2].
      - But we can't shrink _to_ [e1] or [e2] since they are of a
        different type.
      - For faster shrinking, we can also try to shrink such expressions
        to boolean constants directly. *)

    Write a checker for the above property, find any bugs, and fix them. *)

(* FILL IN HERE *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, standard (ty_eq_polymorphic)

    In the [has_type] relation we allowed equality checks between 
    only arithmetic expressions. Introduce an additional typing 
    rule that allows for equality checks between booleans.

    | Ty_Eq : forall Gamma e1 e2, 
        Gamma ||- e1 \IN TBool -> Gamma ||- e2 \IN TBool ->
        Gamma ||- EEq e1 e2 \IN TBool

   Make sure you also update the evaluation relation to 
   compare boolean values. Update the generators and shrinkers
   accordingly to find counterexamples to the buggy properties
   above. 

   HINT: When updating the shrinker, you will need to 
   come up with the type of the equated expressions. The 
   [Dec] instance of [has_type] will come in handy.

(** * Automation (Revisited) *)

(** QuickChick is under very active development.  Our vision is that
    it should automate most of the tedious parts of testing, while
    retaining full customizability.

    We close this case study with a brief demo of some things it can
    do now. *)

(** Recall the [has_type_value] property and its corresponding generator:

  Inductive has_type_value : value -> ty -> Prop :=
    | TyVNat  : forall n, has_type_value (VNat  n) TNat
    | TyVBool : forall b, has_type_value (VBool b) TBool.

  Definition gen_typed_value (T : ty) : G value :=
    match T with 
    | TNat  => n <- arbitrary;; ret (VNat n)
    | TBool => b <- arbitrary;; ret (VBool b)
    end.

    QuickChick includes a derivation mechanism that can _automatically_
    produce such generators -- i.e., generators for data structures 
    satisfying inductively defined properties! *)

Derive ArbitrarySizedSuchThat for (fun v => has_type_value v T).
(** ===> 
  GenSizedSuchThathas_type_value is defined. *)

(** Let's take a closer look at what is being generated (after 
    doing some renaming and reformatting). *)

(** ** (More) Typeclasses for Generation *)

(** QuickChick provides typeclasses for automating the generation 
    for data satisfying predicates. *)

Module GenSTPlayground.

(** A variant that takes a size,... *)

Class GenSizedSuchThat (A : Type) (P : A -> Prop) := 
  { arbitrarySizeST : nat -> G (option A) }.

(** ...an unsized variant,... *)

Class GenSuchThat (A : Type) (P : A -> Prop) := 
  { arbitraryST : G (option A) }.

(** ...convenient notation,... *)

Notation "'genST' x" := (@arbitraryST _ x _) (at level 70).

(** ...and a coercion between the two: *)

Instance GenSuchThatOfBounded (A : Type) (P : A -> Prop) 
         (H : GenSizedSuchThat A P)
  : GenSuchThat A P := 
  { arbitraryST := sized arbitrarySizeST }.

End GenSTPlayground.

(** ** Using "SuchThat" Typeclasses *)

(** QuickChick can now (ab)use the typeclass resolution mechanism to 
    perform a bit of black magic: *)
