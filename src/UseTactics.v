(** * UseTactics: Tactic Library for Coq: A Gentle Introduction *)

(* Chapter written and maintained by Arthur Chargueraud *)

(** Coq comes with a set of builtin tactics, such as [reflexivity],
    [intros], [inversion] and so on. While it is possible to conduct
    proofs using only those tactics, you can significantly increase
    your productivity by working with a set of more powerful tactics.
    This chapter describes a number of such useful tactics, which, for
    various reasons, are not yet available by default in Coq.  These
    tactics are defined in the [LibTactics.v] file. *)

(** Remark: SSReflect is another package providing powerful tactics.
    The library "LibTactics" differs from "SSReflect" in two respects:
        - "SSReflect" was primarily developed for proving mathematical
          theorems, whereas "LibTactics" was primarily developed for proving
          theorems on programming languages. In particular, "LibTactics"
          provides a number of useful tactics that have no counterpart in the
          "SSReflect" package.
        - "SSReflect" entirely rethinks the presentation of tactics,
          whereas "LibTactics" mostly stick to the traditional
          presentation of Coq tactics, simply providing a number of
          additional tactics.  For this reason, "LibTactics" is
          probably easier to get started with than "SSReflect". *)

(** This chapter is a tutorial focusing on the most useful features
    from the "LibTactics" library. It does not aim at presenting all
    the features of "LibTactics". The detailed specification of tactics
    can be found in the source file [LibTactics.v]. Further documentation
    as well as demos can be found at http://www.chargueraud.org/softs/tlc/. *)

(** In this tutorial, tactics are presented using examples taken from
    the core chapters of the "Software Foundations" course. To illustrate
    the various ways in which a given tactic can be used, we use a
    tactic that duplicates a given goal. More precisely, [dup] produces
    two copies of the current goal, and [dup n] produces [n] copies of it. *)

(** * Tactics for Introduction and Case Analysis *)

(** This section presents the following tactics:
    - [introv], for naming hypotheses more efficiently,
    - [inverts], for improving the [inversion] tactic,
    - [cases], for performing a case analysis without losing information,
    - [cases_if], for automating case analysis on the argument of [if]. *)


(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The Tactic [introv] *)

Module IntrovExamples.
  Require Import Stlc.
  Import Imp STLC.

(** The tactic [introv] allows to automatically introduce the
    variables of a theorem and explicitly name the hypotheses
    involved. In the example shown next, the variables [c],
    [st], [st1] and [st2] involved in the statement of determinism
    need not be named explicitly, because their name where already
    given in the statement of the lemma. On the contrary, it is
    useful to provide names for the two hypotheses, which we
    name [E1] and [E2], respectively. *)

Theorem ceval_deterministic: forall c st st1 st2,
  c / st \\ st1 ->
  c / st \\ st2 ->
  st1 = st2.
Proof.
  introv E1 E2. (* was [intros c st st1 st2 E1 E2] *)
Abort.

(** When there is no hypothesis to be named, one can call
    [introv] without any argument. *)

Theorem dist_exists_or : forall (X:Type) (P Q : X -> Prop),
  (exists x, P x \/ Q x) <-> (exists x, P x) \/ (exists x, Q x).
Proof.
  introv. (* was [intros X P Q] *)
Abort.

(** The tactic [introv] also applies to statements in which
    [forall] and [->] are interleaved. *)

Theorem ceval_deterministic': forall c st st1,
  (c / st \\ st1) -> forall st2, (c / st \\ st2) -> st1 = st2.
Proof.
  introv E1 E2. (* was [intros c st st1 E1 st2 E2] *)
Abort.

(** Like the arguments of [intros], the arguments of [introv]
    can be structured patterns. *)

Theorem exists_impl: forall X (P : X -> Prop) (Q : Prop) (R : Prop),
      (forall x, P x -> Q) ->
      ((exists x, P x) -> Q).
Proof.
  introv [x H2]. eauto.
  (* same as [intros X P Q R H1 [x H2].], which is itself short
     for [intros X P Q R H1 H2. destruct H2 as [x H2].] *)
Qed.

(** Remark: the tactic [introv] works even when definitions
    need to be unfolded in order to reveal hypotheses. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The Tactic [inverts] *)

Module InvertsExamples.
  Require Import Stlc Equiv Imp.
  Import STLC.

(** The [inversion] tactic of Coq is not very satisfying for
    three reasons. First, it produces a bunch of equalities
    which one typically wants to substitute away, using [subst].
    Second, it introduces meaningless names for hypotheses.
    Third, a call to [inversion H] does not remove [H] from the
    context, even though in most cases an hypothesis is no longer
    needed after being inverted. The tactic [inverts] address all
    of these three issues. It is intented to be used in place of
    the tactic [inversion]. *)

(** The following example illustrates how the tactic [inverts H]
    behaves mostly like [inversion H] except that it performs
    some substitutions in order to eliminate the trivial equalities
    that are being produced by [inversion]. *)

Theorem skip_left: forall c,
  cequiv (SKIP;; c) c.
Proof.
  introv. split; intros H.
  dup. (* duplicate the goal for comparison *)
  (* was... *)
  - inversion H. subst. inversion H2. subst. assumption.
  (* now... *)
  - inverts H. inverts H2. assumption.
Abort.

(** A slightly more interesting example appears next. *)

Theorem ceval_deterministic: forall c st st1 st2,
  c / st \\ st1  ->
  c / st \\ st2 ->
  st1 = st2.
Proof.
  introv E1 E2. generalize dependent st2.
  induction E1; intros st2 E2.
  admit. admit. (* skip some basic cases *)
  dup. (* duplicate the goal for comparison *)
  (* was: *) 
  - inversion E2. subst. admit.
  (* now: *)
  - inverts E2. admit.
Abort.

(** The tactic [inverts H as.] is like [inverts H] except that the
    variables and hypotheses being produced are placed in the goal
    rather than in the context. This strategy allows naming those
    new variables and hypotheses explicitly, using either [intros]
    or [introv]. *)

Theorem ceval_deterministic': forall c st st1 st2,
  c / st \\ st1  ->
  c / st \\ st2 ->
  st1 = st2.
Proof.
  introv E1 E2. generalize dependent st2.
  (induction E1); intros st2 E2;
    inverts E2 as.
  - (* E_Skip *) reflexivity.
  - (* E_Ass *)
    (* Observe that the variable [n] is not automatically
       substituted because, contrary to [inversion E2; subst],
       the tactic [inverts E2] does not substitute the equalities
       that exist before running the inversion. *)
    (* new: *) subst n.
    reflexivity.
  - (* E_Seq *)
    (* Here, the newly created variables can be introduced
       using intros, so they can be assigned meaningful names,
       for example [st3] instead of [st'0]. *)
    (* new: *) intros st3 Red1 Red2.
    assert (st' = st3) as EQ1.
    { (* Proof of assertion *) apply IHE1_1; assumption. }
    subst st3.
    apply IHE1_2. assumption.
  (* E_IfTrue *)
  - (* b1 reduces to true *)
    (* In an easy case like this one, there is no need to
       provide meaningful names, so we can just use [intros] *)
    (* new: *) intros.
    apply IHE1. assumption.
  - (* b1 reduces to false (contradiction) *)
    (* new: *) intros.
    rewrite H in H5. inversion H5.
  (* The other cases are similiar *)
Abort.

(** In the particular case where a call to [inversion] produces
    a single subgoal, one can use the syntax [inverts H as H1 H2 H3]
    for calling [inverts] and naming the new hypotheses [H1], [H2]
    and [H3]. In other words, the tactic [inverts H as H1 H2 H3] is
    equivalent to [inverts H as; introv H1 H2 H3]. An example follows. *)

Theorem skip_left': forall c,
  cequiv (SKIP;; c) c.
Proof.
  introv. split; intros H.
  inverts H as U V. (* new hypotheses are named [U] and [V] *)
  inverts U. assumption.
Abort.

(** A more involved example appears next. In particular, this example
    shows that the name of the hypothesis being inverted can be reused. *)

Example typing_nonexample_1 :
  ~ exists T,
      has_type empty
        (tabs x TBool
            (tabs y TBool
               (tapp (tvar x) (tvar y))))
        T.
Proof.
  dup 3.

  (* The old proof: *)
  - intros C. destruct C.
  inversion H. subst. clear H.
  inversion H5. subst. clear H5.
  inversion H4. subst. clear H4.
  inversion H2. subst. clear H2.
  inversion H5. subst. clear H5.
  inversion H1.

  (* The new proof: *)
  - intros C. destruct C.
  inverts H as H1.
  inverts H1 as H2.
  inverts H2 as H3.
  inverts H3 as H4.
  inverts H4.

  (* The new proof, alternative: *)
  - intros C. destruct C.
  inverts H as H.
  inverts H as H.
  inverts H as H.
  inverts H as H.
  inverts H.
Qed.

End InvertsExamples.

(** Note: in the rare cases where one needs to perform an inversion
    on an hypothesis [H] without clearing [H] from the context,
    one can use the tactic [inverts keep H], where the keyword [keep]
    indicates that the hypothesis should be kept in the context. *)




(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Tactics for N-ary Connectives *)

(** Because Coq encodes conjunctions and disjunctions using binary
    constructors [/\] and [\/], working with a conjunction or a
    disjunction of [N] facts can sometimes be quite cumbursome.
    For this reason, "LibTactics" provides tactics offering direct
    support for n-ary conjunctions and disjunctions. It also provides
    direct support for n-ary existententials. *)

(** This section presents the following tactics:
    - [splits] for decomposing n-ary conjunctions,
    - [branch] for decomposing n-ary disjunctions,
    - [exists] for proving n-ary existentials. *)

Module NaryExamples.
  Require Import References Smallstep.
  Import STLCRef.


(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The Tactic [splits] *)

(** The tactic [splits] applies to a goal made of a conjunction
    of [n] propositions and it produces [n] subgoals. For example,
    it decomposes the goal [G1 /\ G2 /\ G3] into the three subgoals
    [G1], [G2] and [G3]. *)

Lemma demo_splits : forall n m,
  n > 0 /\ n < m /\ m < n+10 /\ m <> 3.
Proof.
  intros. splits.
Abort.


(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The Tactic [branch] *)

(** The tactic [branch k] can be used to prove a n-ary disjunction.
    For example, if the goal takes the form [G1 \/ G2 \/ G3],
    the tactic [branch 2] leaves only [G2] as subgoal. The following
    example illustrates the behavior of the [branch] tactic. *)

Lemma demo_branch : forall n m,
  n < m \/ n = m \/ m < n.
Proof.
  intros.
  destruct (lt_eq_lt_dec n m) as [[H1|H2]|H3].
  - branch 1. apply H1.
  - branch 2. apply H2.
  - branch 3. apply H3.
Qed.


(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The Tactic [exists] *)

(** The library "LibTactics" introduces a notation for n-ary
    existentials. For example, one can write [exists x y z, H]
    instead of [exists x, exists y, exists z, H]. Similarly,
    the library provides a n-ary tactic [exists a b c], which is a
    shorthand for [exists a; exists b; exists c]. The following
    example illustrates both the notation and the tactic for
    dealing with n-ary existentials. *)

Theorem progress : forall ST t T st,
  has_type empty ST t T ->
  store_well_typed ST st ->
  value t \/ exists t' st', t / st ==> t' / st'.
  (* was: [value t \/ exists t', exists st', t / st ==> t' / st'] *)
Proof with eauto.
  intros ST t T st Ht HST. remember (@empty ty) as Gamma.
  (induction Ht); subst; try solve_by_invert...
  - (* T_App *)
    right. destruct IHHt1 as [Ht1p | Ht1p]...
    + (* t1 is a value *)
      inversion Ht1p; subst; try solve_by_invert.
      destruct IHHt2 as [Ht2p | Ht2p]...
      (* t2 steps *)
      inversion Ht2p as [t2' [st' Hstep]].
      exists (tapp (tabs x T t) t2') st'...
      (* was: [exists (tapp (tabs x T t) t2'). exists st'...] *)
Abort.

(** Remark: a similar facility for n-ary existentials is provided
    by the module [Coq.Program.Syntax] from the standard library.
    ([Coq.Program.Syntax] supports existentials up to arity 4;
    [LibTactics] supports them up to arity 10. *)

(** * Tactics for Working with Equality *)

(** One of the major weakness of Coq compared with other interactive
    proof assistants is its relatively poor support for reasoning
    with equalities. The tactics described next aims at simplifying
    pieces of proof scripts manipulating equalities. *)

(** This section presents the following tactics:
    - [asserts_rewrite] for introducing an equality to rewrite with,
    - [cuts_rewrite], which is similar except that its subgoals are swapped,
    - [substs] for improving the [subst] tactic,
    - [fequals] for improving the [f_equal] tactic,
    - [applys_eq] for proving [P x y] using an hypothesis [P x z],
      automatically producing an equality [y = z] as subgoal. *)

Module EqualityExamples.


(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The Tactics [asserts_rewrite] and [cuts_rewrite] *)

(** The tactic [asserts_rewrite (E1 = E2)] replaces [E1] with [E2] in
    the goal, and produces the goal [E1 = E2]. *)

Theorem mult_0_plus : forall n m : nat,
  (0 + n) * m = n * m.
Proof.
  dup.
  (* The old proof: *)
  intros n m.
  assert (H: 0 + n = n). reflexivity. rewrite -> H.
  reflexivity.

  (* The new proof: *)
  intros n m.
  asserts_rewrite (0 + n = n).
    reflexivity. (* subgoal [0+n = n] *)
    reflexivity. (* subgoal [n*m = m*n] *)
Qed.

(*** Remark: the syntax [asserts_rewrite (E1 = E2) in H] allows
     rewriting in the hypothesis [H] rather than in the goal. *)

(** The tactic [cuts_rewrite (E1 = E2)] is like
    [asserts_rewrite (E1 = E2)], except that the equality [E1 = E2]
    appears as first subgoal. *)

Theorem mult_0_plus' : forall n m : nat,
  (0 + n) * m = n * m.
Proof.
  intros n m.
  cuts_rewrite (0 + n = n).
    reflexivity. (* subgoal [n*m = m*n] *)
    reflexivity. (* subgoal [0+n = n] *)
Qed.

(** More generally, the tactics [asserts_rewrite] and [cuts_rewrite]
    can be provided a lemma as argument. For example, one can write
    [asserts_rewrite (forall a b, a*(S b) = a*b+a)].
    This formulation is useful when [a] and [b] are big terms,
    since there is no need to repeat their statements. *)

Theorem mult_0_plus'' : forall u v w x y z: nat,
  (u + v) * (S (w * x + y)) = z.
Proof.
  intros. asserts_rewrite (forall a b, a*(S b) = a*b+a).
    (* first subgoal:  [forall a b, a*(S b) = a*b+a] *)
    (* second subgoal: [(u + v) * (w * x + y) + (u + v) = z] *)
Abort.


(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The Tactic [substs] *)

(** The tactic [substs] is similar to [subst] except that it
    does not fail when the goal contains "circular equalities",
    such as [x = f x]. *)

Lemma demo_substs : forall x y (f:nat->nat),
  x = f x -> y = x -> y = f x.
Proof.
  intros. substs. (* the tactic [subst] would fail here *)
  assumption.
Qed.


(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The Tactic [fequals] *)

(** The tactic [fequals] is similar to [f_equal] except that it
    directly discharges all the trivial subgoals produced. Moreover,
    the tactic [fequals] features an enhanced treatment of equalities
    between tuples. *)

Lemma demo_fequals : forall (a b c d e : nat) (f : nat->nat->nat->nat->nat),
  a = 1 -> b = e -> e = 2 ->
  f a b c d = f 1 2 c 4.
Proof.
  intros. fequals.
  (* subgoals [a = 1], [b = 2] and [c = c] are proved, [d = 4] remains *)
Abort.


(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The Tactic [applys_eq] *)

(** The tactic [applys_eq] is a variant of [eapply] that introduces
    equalities for subterms that do not unify. For example, assume
    the goal is the proposition [P x y] and assume we have the
    assumption [H] asserting that [P x z] holds. We know that we can
    prove [y] to be equal to [z]. So, we could call the tactic
    [assert_rewrite (y = z)] and change the goal to [P x z], but
    this would require copy-pasting the values of [y] and [z].
    With the tactic [applys_eq], we can call [applys_eq H 1], which
    proves the goal and leaves only the subgoal [y = z]. The value [1]
    given as argument to [applys_eq] indicates that we want an equality
    to be introduced for the first argument of [P x y] counting from
    the right. The three following examples illustrate the behavior
    of a call to [applys_eq H 1], a call to [applys_eq H 2], and a
    call to [applys_eq H 1 2]. *)

Axiom big_expression_using : nat->nat. (* Used in the example *)

Lemma demo_applys_eq_1 : forall (P:nat->nat->Prop) x y z,
  P x (big_expression_using z) ->
  P x (big_expression_using y).
Proof.
  introv H. dup.

  (* The old proof: *)
  assert (Eq: big_expression_using y = big_expression_using z).
    admit. (* Assume we can prove this equality somehow. *)
  rewrite Eq. apply H.

  (* The new proof: *)
  applys_eq H 1.
    admit. (* Assume we can prove this equality somehow. *)
Abort.

(** If the mismatch was on the first argument of [P] instead of
    the second, we would have written [applys_eq H 2]. Recall
    that the occurences are counted from the right. *)

Lemma demo_applys_eq_2 : forall (P:nat->nat->Prop) x y z,
  P (big_expression_using z) x ->
  P (big_expression_using y) x.
Proof.
  introv H. applys_eq H 2.
Abort.

(** When we have a mismatch on two arguments, we want to produce
    two equalities. To achieve this, we may call [applys_eq H 1 2].
    More generally, the tactic [applys_eq] expects a lemma and a
    sequence of natural numbers as arguments. *)

Lemma demo_applys_eq_3 : forall (P:nat->nat->Prop) x1 x2 y1 y2,
  P (big_expression_using x2) (big_expression_using y2) ->
  P (big_expression_using x1) (big_expression_using y1).
Proof.
  introv H. applys_eq H 1 2.
  (* produces two subgoals:
     [big_expression_using x1 = big_expression_using x2]
     [big_expression_using y1 = big_expression_using y2] *)
Abort.

    - [false] for replacing the goal with [False],
    - [gen] as a shorthand for [dependent generalize],
    - [skip] for skipping a subgoal even if it contains existential variables,
    - [sort] for re-ordering the proof context by moving moving all

(** ** The Tactics [false] and [tryfalse] *)

(** The tactic [false] can be used to replace any goal with [False].
    In short, it is a shorthand for [exfalso].
    Moreover, [false] proves the goal if it contains an absurd
    assumption, such as [False] or [0 = S n], or if it contains
    contradictory assumptions, such as [x = true] and [x = false]. *)

(** ** The Tactics [skip], [skip_rewrite] and [skip_goal] *)

(** Temporarily admitting a given subgoal is very useful when
    constructing proofs. It gives the ability to focus first
    on the most interesting cases of a proof. The tactic [skip]
    is like [admit] except that it also works when the proof
    includes existential variables. Recall that existential
    variables are those whose name starts with a question mark,
    (e.g., [?24]), and which are typically introduced by [eapply]. *)

(** The tactic [skip H: P] adds the hypothesis [H: P] to the context,

(** * Tactics for Advanced Lemma Instantiation *)

(** This last section describes a mechanism for instantiating a lemma
    by providing some of its arguments and leaving other implicit.
    Variables whose instantiation is not provided are turned into
    existentential variables, and facts whose instantiation is not
    provided are turned into subgoals.

    Remark: this instantion mechanism goes far beyond the abilities of
    the "Implicit Arguments" mechanism. The point of the instantiation
    mechanism described in this section is that you will no longer need
    to spend time figuring out how many underscore symbols you need to
    write. *)

(** In this section, we'll use a useful feature of Coq for decomposing
    conjunctions and existentials. In short, a tactic like [intros] or
    [destruct] can be provided with a pattern [(H1 & H2 & H3 & H4 & H5)],
    which is a shorthand for [[H1 [H2 [H3 [H4 H5]]]]]]. For example,
    [destruct (H _ _ _ Htypt) as [T [Hctx Hsub]].] can be rewritten in
    the form [destruct (H _ _ _ Htypt) as (T & Hctx & Hsub).] *)


(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Working of [lets] *)

(** When we have a lemma (or an assumption) that we want to exploit,
    we often need to explicitly provide arguments to this lemma,
    writing something like:
    [destruct (typing_inversion_var _ _ _ Htypt) as (T & Hctx & Hsub).]
    The need to write several times the "underscore" symbol is tedious.
    Not only we need to figure out how many of them to write down, but
    it also makes the proof scripts look prettly ugly. With the tactic
    [lets], one can simply write:
    [lets (T & Hctx & Hsub): typing_inversion_var Htypt.]

    In short, this tactic [lets] allows to specialize a lemma on a bunch
    of variables and hypotheses. The syntax is [lets I: E0 E1 .. EN],
    for building an hypothesis named [I] by applying the fact [E0] to the
    arguments [E1] to [EN]. Not all the arguments need to be provided,
    however the arguments that are provided need to be provided in the
    correct order. The tactic relies on a first-match algorithm based on
    types in order to figure out how the to instantiate the lemma with
    the arguments provided. *)

Module ExamplesLets.
  Require Import Sub.

(* To illustrate the working of [lets], assume that we want to
   exploit the following lemma. *)

Axiom typing_inversion_var : forall (G:context) (x:id) (T:ty),
  has_type G (tvar x) T ->
  exists S, G x = Some S /\ subtype S T.

(** First, assume we have an assumption [H] with the type of the form
    [has_type G (tvar x) T]. We can obtain the conclusion of the
    lemma [typing_inversion_var] by invoking the tactics
    [lets K: typing_inversion_var H], as shown next. *)

Lemma demo_lets_1 : forall (G:context) (x:id) (T:ty),
  has_type G (tvar x) T -> True.
Proof.
  intros G x T H. dup.

  (* step-by-step: *)
  lets K: typing_inversion_var H.
  destruct K as (S & Eq & Sub).
  admit.

  (* all-at-once: *)
  lets (S & Eq & Sub): typing_inversion_var H.
  admit.
Abort.

(** Assume now that we know the values of [G], [x] and [T] and we
    want to obtain [S], and have [has_type G (tvar x) T] be produced
    as a subgoal. To indicate that we want all the remaining arguments
    of [typing_inversion_var] to be produced as subgoals, we use a
    triple-underscore symbol [___]. (We'll later introduce a shorthand
    tactic called [forwards] to avoid writing triple underscores.) *)

Lemma demo_lets_2 : forall (G:context) (x:id) (T:ty), True.
Proof.
  intros G x T.
  lets (S & Eq & Sub): typing_inversion_var G x T ___.
Abort.

(** Usually, there is only one context [G] and one type [T] that are
    going to be suitable for proving [has_type G (tvar x) T], so
    we don't really need to bother giving [G] and [T] explicitly.
    It suffices to call [lets (S & Eq & Sub): typing_inversion_var x].
    The variables [G] and [T] are then instantiated using existential
    variables. *)

Lemma demo_lets_3 : forall (x:id), True.
Proof.
  intros x.
  lets (S & Eq & Sub): typing_inversion_var x ___.
Abort.

(** We may go even further by not giving any argument to instantiate
    [typing_inversion_var]. In this case, three unification variables
    are introduced. *)

Lemma demo_lets_4 : True.
Proof.
  lets (S & Eq & Sub): typing_inversion_var ___.
Abort.

(** Note: if we provide [lets] with only the name of the lemma as
    argument, it simply adds this lemma in the proof context, without
    trying to instantiate any of its arguments. *)

Lemma demo_lets_5 : True.
Proof.
  lets H: typing_inversion_var.
Abort.

(** A last useful feature of [lets] is the double-underscore symbol,
    which allows skipping an argument when several arguments have
    the same type. In the following example, our assumption quantifies
    over two variables [n] and [m], both of type [nat]. We would like
    [m] to be instantiated as the value [3], but without specifying a
    value for [n]. This can be achieved by writting [lets K: H __ 3]. *)

Lemma demo_lets_underscore :
  (forall n m, n <= m -> n < m+1) -> True.
Proof.
  intros H.

  (* If we do not use a double underscore, the first argument,
     which is [n], gets instantiated as 3. *)
  lets K: H 3. (* gives [K] of type [forall m, 3 <= m -> 3 < m+1] *)
    clear K.

  (* The double underscore preceeding [3] indicates that we want
     to skip a value that has the type [nat] (because [3] has
     the type [nat]). So, the variable [m] gets instiated as [3]. *)
  lets K: H __ 3. (* gives [K] of type [?X <= 3 -> ?X < 3+1] *)
    clear K.
Abort.


(** Note: one can write [lets: E0 E1 E2] in place of [lets H: E0 E1 E2].
    In this case, the name [H] is chosen arbitrarily.

    Note: the tactics [lets] accepts up to five arguments. Another
    syntax is available for providing more than five arguments.
    It consists in using a list introduced with the special symbol [>>],
    for example [lets H: (>> E0 E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7 E8 E9 10)]. *)

End ExamplesLets.


(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Working of [applys], [forwards] and [specializes] *)

(** The tactics [applys], [forwards] and [specializes] are
    shorthand that may be used in place of [lets] to perform
    specific tasks.

    - [forwards] is a shorthand for instantiating all the arguments
    of a lemma. More precisely, [forwards H: E0 E1 E2 E3] is the
    same as [lets H: E0 E1 E2 E3 ___], where the triple-underscore
    has the same meaning as explained earlier on.

    - [applys] allows building a lemma using the advanced instantion
    mode of [lets], and then apply that lemma right away. So,
    [applys E0 E1 E2 E3] is the same as [lets H: E0 E1 E2 E3]
    followed with [eapply H] and then [clear H].

    - [specializes] is a shorthand for instantiating in-place
    an assumption from the context with particular arguments.
    More precisely, [specializes H E0 E1] is the same as
    [lets H': H E0 E1] followed with [clear H] and [rename H' into H].

    Examples of use of [applys] appear further on. Several examples of
    use of [forwards] can be found in the tutorial chapter [UseAuto]. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Summary *)

(** In this chapter we have presented a number of tactics that help make
    proof script more concise and more robust on change.

    - [introv] and [inverts] improve naming and inversions.

    - [false] and [tryfalse] help discarding absurd goals.

    - [unfolds] automatically calls [unfold] on the head definition.

    - [gen] helps setting up goals for induction.

    - [cases] and [cases_if] help with case analysis.

    - [splits], [branch] and [exists] to deal with n-ary constructs.

    - [asserts_rewrite], [cuts_rewrite], [substs] and [fequals] help
      working with equalities.

    - [lets], [forwards], [specializes] and [applys] provide means
      of very conveniently instantiating lemmas.

    - [applys_eq] can save the need to perform manual rewriting steps
      before being able to apply lemma.

    - [skip], [skip_rewrite] and [skip_goal] give the flexibility to
      choose which subgoals to try and discharge first.

    Making use of these tactics can boost one's productivity in Coq proofs.
