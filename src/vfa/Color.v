   _Coloring_ an undirected graph means, assigning a color to each node,
  so that any two nodes directly connected by an edge have different colors.
  The _chromatic number_ of a graph is the minimum number of colors
  needed to color the graph.  Graph coloring is NP-complete, so there is no
  polynomial-time algorithm; but we need to do it anyway, for applications
  such as register allocation in compilers.  So therefore we often use 
  incomplete algorithms:  ones that work only on certain classes of graphs,
  or ones that color _most_ but not all of the nodes.  Those algorithms are
  often good enough for important applications.

  In this chapter we will study Kempe's algorithm for K-coloring a graph.
  It was invented by Alfred Kempe in 1879, for use in his attempt to prove
  the four-color theorem (that every planar graph is 4-colorable).  His 4-color
  proof had a bug; but his algorithm continues to be useful:  a (major) variation of
  it was used in the successful 1976 proof of the 4-color theorem, and in 1979 
  Kempe's algorithm was adapted by Gregory Chaitin for application to register 
  allocation. It is the Kempe-Chaitin algorithm that we'll prove here.

  We implement a program to K-color an undirected graph, perhaps leaving
  some nodes uncolored.  In a register-allocation problem, the graph nodes
  correspond to variables in a program, the colors correspond to registers,
  and the graph edges are interference constraints:  two nodes connected
  by an edge cannot be assigned the same color.  Nodes left uncolored are
  "spilled," that is, a register allocator would implement such nodes in 
  memory locations instead of in registers.  We desire to have as few
  uncolored nodes as possible, but this desire is not formally specified.

  In this exercise we show a simple and unsophisticated algorithm; the program
  described by Blazy et al. (cited above) is more sophisticated in several ways,
  such as the use of "register coalescing" to get better results and the use of 
  worklists to make it run faster.  

  Our algorithm does, at least, make use of efficient data structures for
  representing undirected graphs, adjacency sets, and so on. *)

(** * Preliminaries: Representing Graphs *)

(** In the [Trie] chapter we saw how to represent efficient maps (lookup tables)
    where the keys are [positive] numbers in Coq.  Those tries are implemented
    in the Coq standard library as [FMaps], functional maps, and we will use them
   directly from the standard library.   [FMaps] represent _partial functions_, that is,
   mapping keys to [option(t)] for whatever [t].

   We will also use [FSets], efficient sets of keys; you can _think_ of those as FMaps from 
   keys to [unit], where [None] means absent and [Some tt] means present; but their
   implementation is a bit more efficient. *)

From VFA Require Import Perm.   (* to use <? notation and [bdestruct] tactic *)

(** The nodes in our graph will be named by positive numbers.
  [FSets] and [FMaps] are interfaces for sets and maps over an element type.
  One instance is when the element type is [positive], with a particular
  comparison operator corresponding to easy lookup in tries.  The 
  Coq module for this element type (with its total order) is [PositiveOrderedTypeBits].
  We'll use [E] as an abbreviation for this module name.  *)

Module E := PositiveOrderedTypeBits.
Print Module E.
Print E.t.

(** The [Module Type FSetInterface.S] gives the API of "functional sets."
   One instance of this, [PositiveSet], has keys = positive numbers.  We
   abbreviate this as [Module S]. *)

(** * Lemmas About Sets and Maps *)

(** In order to reason about a graph coloring algorithm, we need to 
   prove lemmas such as, "if you remove an element (one domain->range binding)
   from a finite map, then the result is a new finite map whose domain
   has fewer elements."  (Duh!)  But to prove this, we need to build up
   some definitions and lemmas.  We start by importing some modules
   that have some already-proved properties of FMaps. *)

Check E.lt. (*   : positive -> positive -> Prop *)

(** [E.lt] is a comparison predicate on [positive] numbers.  It 
   is _not_ the usual less-than operator; it is a different ordering
   that is more compatible with the order that a Positive Trie arranges
   its keys.  In the application of certain lemmas about maps and sets,
   we will need the facts that [E.lt] is a [StrictOrder] (irreflexive and
   transitive) and respects a congruence over equality (is [Proper]
   for [eq ==> eq ==> iff]).   As shown here, we just have to dig up
   these facts from a submodule of a submodule of a submodule of [M]. *)

Lemma lt_strict: StrictOrder E.lt.
Proof. exact M.ME.MO.IsTO.lt_strorder. Qed.

Lemma lt_proper: Proper (eq ==> eq ==> iff) E.lt.
Proof. exact M.ME.MO.IsTO.lt_compat. Qed.

(** The domain of a map is the set of elements that map to [Some(_)].  To calculate
   the domain, we can use [M.fold], an operation that comes with the [FMaps] 
   abstract data type.  It takes a map [m], function [f] and base value [b], and calculates 
   [f x1 y1 (f x2 y2 (f x3 y3 (... (f xn yn b)...)))], where [(xi,yi)] are the individual elements
   of [m].  That is, [M.find xi m = Some yi], for each [i].

   So, to compute the domain, we just use an [f] function that adds [xi] to a set;
   mapping this over all the nodes will add all the keys in [m] to the set [S.empty].  *)

Definition Mdomain {A} (m: M.t A) : S.t := 
   M.fold (fun n _ s => S.add n s) m S.empty.

(** Example:  Make a map from _node_ (represented as [positive]) to 
      _set of node_ (represented as [S.t]), in which nodes [3,9,2] each map 
      to the empty set, and no other nodes map to anything. *)

Definition example_map : M.t S.t :=
(M.add 3%positive S.empty 
  (M.add 9%positive S.empty 
   (M.add 2%positive S.empty (M.empty S.t   )))).

Example domain_example_map: 
    S.elements (Mdomain example_map) = [2;9;3]%positive.
Proof. compute. reflexivity. Qed.

            forall x : A, InA eqA x l <-> InA eqA x l'
   : forall {A:Type}, (A->A->Prop) -> list A -> list A -> Prop *)

(** Suppose two lists [al,bl] both contain the same elements, not necessarily in the same
     order.  That is, [forall x:A, In x al <-> In x bl].  In fact from this definition you can
     see that [al] or [bl] might even have different numbers of repetitions of certain
     elements.  Then we say the lists are "equivalent."

     We can generalize this.  Suppose instead of [In x al], which says that the value [x]
     is in the list [al], we use a different equivalence relation on that [A].  That is,
     [InA eqA x al] says that some element of [al] is _equivalent_ to [x], using the
     equivalence relation [eqA].  For example: *)

Proof. right.  left. compute. reflexivity. Qed.

(** The predicate [equivlistA eqA al bl] says that lists [al] and [bl] have equivalent
    sets of elements, using the equivalence relation [eqA].  For example: *)

(** ** SortA_equivlistA_eqlistA

    Suppose two lists [al,bl] are "equivalent:" they contain the same set of elements
    (modulo an equivalence relation [eqA] on elements, perhaps in different orders, 
    and perhaps with different numbers of repetitions).  That is, suppose
    [equivlistA eqA al bl].

    And suppose list [al] is sorted, in some strict total order (respecting the same equivalence
    relation [eqA]).  And suppose list [bl] is sorted.  Then the lists must be _equal_
    (modulo [eqA]).   

    Just to make this easier to think about, suppose [eqA] is just ordinary equality.
    Then if [al] and [bl] contain the same set of elements (perhaps reordered),
    and each list is sorted (by _less-than_, not by _less-or-equal_), then they must be equal.  Obviously.

    That's what the theorem [SortA_equivlistA_eqlistA] says, in the Coq library: *)

Check SortA_equivlistA_eqlistA.    (*
     : forall (A : Type) (eqA : A -> A -> Prop),
       Equivalence eqA ->
       forall ltA : A -> A -> Prop,
       StrictOrder ltA ->
       Proper (eqA ==> eqA ==> iff) ltA ->
       forall l l' : list A,
       Sorted ltA l ->
       Sorted ltA l' -> equivlistA eqA l l' -> eqlistA eqA l l'  *)

(** That is, suppose [eqA] is an equivalence relation on type [A], that is,
     [eqA] is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.  And suppose [ltA] is a strict order,
     that is, irreflexive and transitive.   And suppose [ltA] respects the equivalence
     relation, that is, if [eqA x x'] and [eqA y y'], then [ltA x y <-> ltA x' y'].
     THEN, if [l] is sorted (using the comparison [ltA]), and l' is sorted,
     and [l,l'] contain equivalent sets of elements, then [l,l'] must be equal lists,
     modulo the equivalence relation.

    To make this easier to think about, let's use ordinary equality for eqA. 
    We will be making sets and maps over the "node" type, [E.t], but that's just
    type [positive].  Therefore, the equivalence [E.eq: E.t -> E.t -> Prop] is just
    the same as [eq]. *)

Goal E.t = positive.  Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
Goal E.eq = @eq positive.  Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** And therefore, [eqlistA E.eq al bl] means the same as [al=bl]. *)

Lemma eqlistA_Eeq_eq: forall al bl, eqlistA E.eq al bl <-> al=bl.
Proof.

* induction H. reflexivity. unfold E.eq in H. subst. reflexivity.
* subst. induction bl. constructor. constructor.
   unfold E.eq. reflexivity. assumption.

(** So now, the theorem:  if [al] and [bl] are sorted, and contain "the same" elements,
   then they are equal: *)

Lemma SortE_equivlistE_eqlistE:
 forall al bl, Sorted E.lt al ->
                   Sorted E.lt bl ->
                   equivlistA E.eq al bl -> eqlistA E.eq al bl.
Proof.
  apply SortA_equivlistA_eqlistA; auto.
  apply lt_strict.
  apply lt_proper.
Qed.

(** If list [l] is sorted, and you apply [List.filter] to remove the elements on which
     [f] is [false], then the result is still sorted.  Obviously.  *)

Lemma filter_sortE: forall f l, 
     Sorted E.lt l -> Sorted E.lt (List.filter f l).
Proof.
  apply filter_sort with E.eq; auto.
  apply lt_strict.
