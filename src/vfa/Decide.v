(** * Using [reflect] to characterize decision procedures *)

(** Thus far in _Verified Functional Algorithms_ we have been using
   - propositions ([Prop]) such as [a<b] (which is Notation for [lt a b])
   - booleans ([bool]) such as [a<?b] (which is Notation for [ltb a b]). *)

Check Nat.lt.  (* : nat -> nat -> Prop *)
Check Nat.ltb.  (* : nat -> nat -> bool *)

(** The [Perm] chapter defined a tactic called [bdestruct] that
    does case analysis on (x <? y) while giving you hypotheses (above
    the line) of the form (x<y).   This tactic is built using the [reflect] 
    type and the [ltb_reflect] theorem. *)

Print reflect.
(* Inductive reflect (P : Prop) : bool -> Set :=
    | ReflectT : P -> reflect P true 
    | ReflectF : ~ P -> reflect P false  *)

Check ltb_reflect.  (* : forall x y, reflect (x<y) (x <? y) *)

(** The name [reflect] for this type is a reference to _computational
   reflection_,  a technique in logic.  One takes a logical formula, or 
   proposition, or predicate,  and designs a syntactic embedding of 
   this formula as an "object value" in the logic.  That is, _reflect_ the
   formula back into the logic. Then one can design computations 
   expressible inside the logic that manipulate these syntactic object 
   values.  Finally, one proves that the computations make transformations
   that are equivalent to derivations (or equivalences) in the logic.

   The first use of computational reflection was by Goedel, in 1931:
   his syntactic embedding encoded formulas as natural numbers, a 
   "Goedel numbering."  The second and third uses of reflection were
   by Church and Turing, in 1936: they encoded (respectively) 
   lambda-expressions and Turing machines.

   In Coq it is easy to do reflection, because the Calculus of Inductive
   Constructions (CiC) has Inductive data types that can easily encode 
   syntax trees.  We could, for example, take some of our propositional 
   operators such as [and], [or], and make an [Inductive] type that is an 
   encoding of these, and build a computational reasoning system for
   boolean satisfiability.

   But in this chapter I will show something much simpler.  When 
   reasoning about less-than comparisons on natural numbers, we have
   the advantage that [nat] already an inductive type; it is "pre-reflected,"
   in some sense.  (The same for [Z], [list], [bool], etc.)  *)

(** Now, let's examine how [reflect] expresses the coherence between
  [lt] and [ltb]. Suppose we have a value [v] whose type is 
  [reflect (3<7) (3<?7)].  What is [v]?  Either it is
  - ReflectT [P] (3<?7), where [P] is a proof of [3<7],  and [3<?7] is [true], or
  - ReflectF [Q] (3<?7), where [Q] is a proof of [~(3<7)], and [3<?7] is [false].
  In the case of [3,7], we are well advised to use [ReflectT], because
   (3<?7) cannot match the [false] required by [ReflectF]. *)

Goal (3<?7 = true). Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** So [v] cannot be [ReflectF Q (3<?7)] for any [Q], because that would
   not type-check.  Now, the next question:  must there exist a value
   of type [reflect (3<7) (3<?7)]  ?  The answer is yes; that is the
   [ltb_reflect] theorem.  The result of [Check ltb_reflect], above, says that
   for any [x,y], there does exist a value (ltb_reflect x y) whose type
   is exactly [reflect (x<y)(x<?y)].     So let's look at that value!  That is,
   examine what [H], and [P], and [Q] are equal to at "Case 1" and "Case 2": *)

Theorem three_less_seven_1: 3<7.
Proof.
assert (H := ltb_reflect 3 7).
remember (3<?7) as b.
destruct H as [P|Q] eqn:?.
* (* Case 1: H = ReflectT (3<7) P *)
apply P.
* (* Case 2: H = ReflectF (3<7) Q *)
compute in Heqb.
inversion Heqb.
Qed.

(** Here is another proof that uses [inversion] instead of [destruct].
   The [ReflectF] case is eliminated automatically by [inversion]
   because [3<?7] does not match [false]. *)

Theorem three_less_seven_2: 3<7.
Proof.
assert (H := ltb_reflect 3 7).
inversion H as [P|Q].
apply P.
Qed.

(** The [reflect] inductive data type is a way of relating a _decision
   procedure_ (a function from X to [bool]) with a predicate (a function
   from X to [Prop]).   The convenience of [reflect], in the verification
   of functional programs, is that we can do [destruct (ltb_reflect a b)],
   which relates [a<?b] (in the program) to the [a<b] (in the proof).
   That's just how the [bdestruct] tactic works; you can go back
   to [Perm.v] and examine how it is implemented in the [Ltac]
   tactic-definition language. *)

(** * Using [sumbool] to Characterize Decision Procedures *)

Module ScratchPad.

(** An alternate way to characterize decision procedures,
   widely used in Coq, is via the inductive type [sumbool].

   Suppose [Q]  is a proposition, that is, [Q: Prop].  We say [Q] is
   _decidable_ if there is an algorithm for computing a proof of
   [Q] or [~Q].  More generally, when [P] is a predicate (a function 
   from some type [T] to [Prop]), we say [P] is decidable when 
   [forall x:T, decidable(P)].

   We represent this concept in Coq by an inductive datatype: *)

Inductive sumbool (A B : Prop) : Set :=
 | left : A -> sumbool A B
 | right : B -> sumbool A B.

(** Let's consider [sumbool] applied to two propositions: *)

Definition t1 := sumbool (3<7) (3>2).
Lemma less37: 3<7. Proof. omega. Qed.
Lemma greater23: 3>2. Proof. omega. Qed.

Definition v1a: t1 := left (3<7) (3>2) less37.
Definition v1b: t1 := right (3<7) (3>2) greater23.

(** A value of type [sumbool (3<7) (3>2)] is either one of:
  - [left] applied to a proof of (3<7), or
  - [right] applied to a proof of (3>2).   *)

(** Now let's consider: *)

Definition t2 := sumbool (3<7) (2>3).
Definition v2a: t2 := left (3<7) (2>3) less37.

(** A value of type [sumbool (3<7) (2>3)] is either one of:
  - [left] applied to a proof of (3<7), or
  - [right] applied to a proof of (2>3).
  But since there are no proofs of 2>3, only [left] values (such as [v2a])
  exist.  That's OK. *)

(** [sumbool] is in the Coq standard library, where there is [Notation] 
   for it:  the expression [ {A}+{B} ] means [sumbool A B]. *)

Notation "{ A } + { B }" := (sumbool A B) : type_scope.

(** A very common use of [sumbool] is on a proposition and its negation.
   For example, *)

Definition t4 := forall a b, {a<b}+{~(a<b)}.

(** That expression, [forall a b, {a<b}+{~(a<b)}], says that for any 
 natural numbers [a] and [b], either [a<b] or [a>=b].  But it is _more_
 than that!  Because [sumbool] is an Inductive type with two constructors
 [left] and [right], then given the [{3<7}+{~(3<7)}] you can pattern-match
 on it and learn _constructively_ which thing is true.  *)

Definition v3: {3<7}+{~(3<7)} := left _ _ less37.

Definition is_3_less_7:  bool :=
 match v3 with
 | left _ _ _ => true
 | right _ _ _ => false
 end.

Eval compute in is_3_less_7. (* = true : bool *)

Print t4.  (* = forall a b : nat, {a < b} + {~ a < b} *)

(** Suppose there existed a value [lt_dec] of type [t4].  That would be a 
  _decision procedure_ for the less-than function on natural numbers.
  For any nats [a] and [b], you could calculate [lt_dec a b], which would
  be either [left ...] (if [a<b] was provable) or [right ...] (if [~(a<b)] was
  provable).

  Let's go ahead and implement [lt_dec].  We can base it on the function
  [ltb: nat -> nat -> bool] which calculates whether [a] is less than [b],
  as a boolean.  We already have a theorem that this function on booleans
  is related to the proposition [a<b]; that theorem is called [ltb_reflect]. *)

Check ltb_reflect.  (* : forall x y, reflect (x<y) (x<?y) *)

(** It's not too hard to use [ltb_reflect] to define [lt_dec] *)

Definition lt_dec (a: nat) (b: nat) : {a<b}+{~(a<b)} :=
match ltb_reflect a b with
| ReflectT _ P => left (a < b) (~ a < b) P
| ReflectF _ Q => right (a < b) (~ a < b) Q
end.

(** Another, equivalent way to define [lt_dec] is to use 
     definition-by-tactic: *)

Definition lt_dec' (a: nat) (b: nat) : {a<b}+{~(a<b)}.
  destruct (ltb_reflect a b) as [P|Q]. left. apply P.  right. apply Q.
Defined.

Print lt_dec.
Print lt_dec'.

Theorem lt_dec_equivalent: forall a b, lt_dec a b = lt_dec' a b.
Proof.
intros.
unfold lt_dec, lt_dec'.
reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Warning: these definitions of [lt_dec] are not as nice as the
  definition in the Coq standard library, because these are not
  fully computable.  See the discussion below. *)

(** The output of [Print sumbool] explains that the first two arguments 
   of [left] and [right] are implicit.  We use them as follows (notice that
   [left] has only one explicit argument [P]:  *)

Definition lt_dec (a: nat) (b: nat) : {a<b}+{~(a<b)} :=

(** Now, let's use [le_dec] directly in the implementation of insertion
   sort, without mentioning [ltb] at all. *)

Fixpoint insert (x:nat) (l: list nat) := 
  match l with
  | nil => x::nil

    sorted nil
| sorted_1: forall x,
    sorted (x::nil)

    destruct (le_dec a x) as [ Hle | Hgt].

   (** Look at the proof state now.  In the first subgoal, we have
      above the line, [Hle: a <= x].  In the second subgoal, we have
      [Hgt: ~ (a < x)].  These are put there automatically by the 
      [destruct (le_dec a x)].  Now, the rest of the proof can proceed
      as it did in [Sort.v], but using [destruct (le_dec _ _)] instead of
      [bdestruct (_ <=? _)]. *)

(** * Decidability and Computability *)

(** Before studying the rest of this chapter, it is helpful to study the
   [ProofObjects] chapter of _Software Foundations volume 1_ if you
   have not done so already.

   A predicate [P: T->Prop] is _decidable_ if there is a computable
   function [f: T->bool] such that, forall [x:T], [f x = true <-> P x].
   The second and most famous example of an _undecidable_ predicate
   is the Halting Problem (Turing, 1936): [T] is the type of Turing-machine
   descriptions, and [P(x)] is, Turing machine [x] halts.  The first, and not
   as famous, example is due to Church, 1936 (six months earlier): test
   whether a lambda-expression has a normal form.  In 1936-37, as a 
   first-year PhD student before beginning his PhD thesis work, Turing
   proved these two problems are equivalent.

   Classical logic contains the axiom [forall P, P \/ ~P].  This is not provable
   in core Coq, that is, in the bare Calculus of Inductive Constructions.  But
   its negation is not provable either.   You could add this axiom to Coq
   and the system would still be consistent (i.e., no way to prove [False]).

   But [P \/ ~P] is a weaker statement than [ {P}+{~P} ], that is,
   [sumbool P (~P)].  From [ {P}+{~P} ] you can actually _calculate_ or
   [compute] either [left (x:P)] or [right(y: ~P)].     From [P \/ ~P] you cannot 
   [compute] whether [P] is true.  Yes, you can [destruct] it in a proof, 
   but not in a calculation.  

   For most purposes its unnecessary to add the axiom [P \/ ~P] to Coq,
   because for specific predicates there's a specific way to prove [P \/ ~P]
   as a theorem.  For example,  less-than on natural numbers is decidable,
   and the existence of [ltb_reflect] or [lt_dec] (as a theorem, not as an axiom)
   is a demonstration of that.

   Furthermore, in this "book" we are interested in _algorithms_.  An axiom
   [P \/ ~P] does not give us an algorithm to compute whether P is true.  As
   you saw in the definition of [insert] above, we can use [lt_dec] not only as
   a theorem that either [3<7] or [~(3<7)], we can use it as a function to
   compute whether [3<7].  In Coq, you can't compute with axioms!
   Let's try it: *)

Axiom lt_dec_axiom_1:  forall i j: nat, i<j \/ ~(i<j).

(** Now, can we use this axiom to compute with?  *)

(* Uncomment and try this: 
Definition max (i j: nat) : nat :=
   if lt_dec_axiom_1 i j then j else i.
*)

(** That doesn't work, because an [if] statement requires an [Inductive]
  data type with exactly two constructors; but [lt_dec_axiom_1 i j] has
  type [i<j \/ ~(i<j)],  which is not Inductive.  But let's try a different axiom: *)

Axiom lt_dec_axiom_2:  forall i j: nat, {i<j} + {~(i<j)}.

Definition max_with_axiom (i j: nat) : nat :=
   if lt_dec_axiom_2 i j then j else i.

(** This typechecks, because [lt_dec_axiom_2 i j]  belongs to type
     [sumbool (i<j) (~(i<j))]   (also written [ {i<j} + {~(i<j)} ]), which does have
     two constructors.

     Now, let's use this function: *)

Eval compute in max_with_axiom 3 7.
  (*  = if lt_dec_axiom_2 3 7 then 7 else 3
     : nat *)

(** This [compute] didn't compute very much!  Let's try to evaluate it
    using [unfold]: *)

Lemma prove_with_max_axiom:   max_with_axiom 3 7 = 7.
Proof.
unfold max_with_axiom.
try reflexivity.  (* does not do anything, reflexivity fails *)
(* uncomment this line and try it: 
   unfold lt_dec_axiom_2.
*)
destruct (lt_dec_axiom_2 3 7).
reflexivity.
contradiction n. omega.
Qed.

(** It is dangerous to add Axioms to Coq: if you add one that's inconsistent,
   then it leads to the ability to prove [False].  While that's a convenient way
   to get a lot of things proved, it's unsound; the proofs are useless.  

   The Axioms above, [lt_dec_axiom_1] and [lt_dec_axiom_2], are safe enough:
   they are consistent.  But they don't help in computation.  Axioms are not
   useful here. *)

End ScratchPad2.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Opacity of [Qed] *)

(** This lemma [prove_with_max_axiom] turned out to be _provable_, but the proof
    could not go by _computation_.  In contrast, let's use [lt_dec], which was built
    without any axioms: *)

(** Unfortunately, even though [ltb_reflect] was proved without any axioms, it

    one cannot compute with opaque theorems.  Not only that, but it is proved with
    other opaque theorems such as [iff_sym] and [Nat.ltb_lt].  If we want to
    compute with an implementation of [lt_dec] built from [ltb_reflect], then
    we will have to rebuild [ltb_reflect] without using [Qed] anywhere, only [Defined].

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Advantages and Disadvantages of [reflect] Versus [sumbool] *)

(** I have shown two ways to program decision procedures in Coq,
    one using [reflect] and the other using [{_}+{~_}], i.e., [sumbool].

   - With [sumbool], you define _two_ things: the operator in [Prop]
      such as [lt: nat -> nat -> Prop] and the decidability "theorem"
      in [sumbool], such as [lt_dec: forall i j, {lt i j}+{~ lt i j}].  I say
      "theorem" in quotes because it's not _just_ a theorem, it's also
      a (nonopaque) computable function.

   - With [reflect], you define _three_ things:  the operator in [Prop],
      the operator in [bool] (such as [ltb: nat -> nat -> bool], and the
      theorem that relates them (such as [ltb_reflect]).  

   Defining three things seems like more work than defining two.
   But it may be easier and more efficient.  Programming in [bool],
   you may have more control over how your functions are implemented,
   you will have fewer difficult uses of dependent types, and you
   will run into fewer difficulties with opaque theorems.

   However, among Coq programmers, [sumbool] seems to be more
   widely used, and it seems to have better support in the Coq standard
   library.  So you may encounter it, and it is worth understanding what
   it does.   Either of these two methods is a reasonable way of programming
   with proof.  *)
