(** * Binom: Binomial Queues *)

(** Implementation and correctness proof of fast mergeable priority queues
   using binomial queues.

  Operation [empty] is constant time,  [insert], [delete_max], and [merge]
  are logN time.  (Well, except that comparisons on [nat] take linear time.
  Read the [Extract] chapter to see what can be done about that.) *)

(** A priority queue (using the binomial queues data structure) is a
   list of trees.  The [i]'th element of the list is either [Leaf] or
   it is a power-of-2-heap with exactly [2^i] nodes.

  This program will make sense to you if you've read the Sedgewick
  reading; otherwise it is rather mysterious.

  _any_ permutation of its keys, not just a single permutation.
  You should make your [priqueue_elems] relation behave similarly,
  using (basically) the same technique as in [tree_elems].
