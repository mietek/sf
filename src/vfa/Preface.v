(** * Preface *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Welcome *)

(** Here's a good way to build formally verified correct software:
 - Write your program in an expressive language with a good proof theory
      (the Gallina language embedded in Coq's logic).
 - Prove it correct in Coq.
 - Compile it with an optimizing ML compiler.

 Since you want your programs to be _efficient_, you'll want to
 implement sophisticated data structures and algorithms.  Since
 Gallina is a _purely functional_ language, it helps to have
 purely functional algorithms.

 In this volume you will learn how to specify and verify (prove the
 correctness of) sorting algorithms, binary search trees, balanced
 binary search trees, and priority queues.  Before using this book,
 you should have some understanding of these algorithms and data
 structures, available in any standard undergraduate algorithms
 textbook.

 This electronic book is Volume 3 of the _Software Foundations_
 series, which presents the mathematical underpinnings of reliable
 software.  It builds on _Software Foundations Volume 1_
 (Logical Foundations), but does not depend on Volume 2.
 The exposition here is intended for a broad range of readers, from
 advanced undergraduates to PhD students and researchers.

 The principal novelty of _Software Foundations_ is that it is one
 hundred percent formalized and machine-checked: the entire text is
 literally a script for Coq.  It is intended to be read alongside an
 interactive session with Coq.  All the details in the text are fully
 formalized in Coq, and the exercises are designed to be worked using
 Coq.

(** * Practicalities *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Chapter Dependencies *)

(** Before using _Verified Functional Algorithms_, read
    (and do the exercises in) these chapters of
    _Software Foundations Volume I_:
      Preface, Basics, Induction, Lists, Poly, Tactics, Logic,
      IndProp, Maps, and perhaps (ProofObjects), (IndPrinciples).

    In this volume, the core path is:

    [Preface] -> [Perm] -> [Sort] -> [SearchTree] -> [Extract] -> [Redblack]

    with many optional chapters whose dependencies are,

    - [Sort] -> [Multiset] or [Selection] or [Decide]
    - [SearchTree] -> [ADT]
    - [Perm] -> [Trie]
    - [Sort] -> [Selection] -> [SearchTree] -> [ADT] -> [Priqueue] -> [Binom]

    The [Color] chapter is advanced material that should not be
    attempted until the student has had experience with most
    of the earlier chapters, or other experience using Coq.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** System Requirements *)

(** Coq runs on Windows, Linux, and OS X.  The Preface of Volume 1
    describes the Coq installation you will need.  This edition was
    built with Coq 8.9.1 or later.

    In addition, two of the chapters ask you to compile and run an
    OCaml program; having OCaml installed on your computer is helpful,
    but not essential. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Exercises *)

(** Each chapter includes numerous exercises.  Each is marked with a
    "star rating," which can be interpreted as follows:

       - One star: easy exercises that underscore points in the text
         and that, for most readers, should take only a minute or two.
         Get in the habit of working these as you reach them.

       - Two stars: straightforward exercises (five or ten minutes).

       - Three stars: exercises requiring a bit of thought (ten
         minutes to half an hour).

       - Four and five stars: more difficult exercises (half an hour
         and up).

    Also, some exercises are marked "advanced", and some are marked
    "optional."  Doing just the non-optional, non-advanced exercises
    should provide good coverage of the core material.  Optional
    exercises provide a bit of extra practice with key concepts and
    introduce secondary themes that may be of interest to some
    readers.  Advanced exercises are for readers who want an extra
    challenge (and, in return, a deeper contact with the material).

    _Please do not post solutions to the exercises in any public place_: 
    Software Foundations is widely used both for self-study and for
    university courses.  Having solutions easily available makes it
    much less useful for courses, which typically have graded homework
    assignments.  The authors especially request that readers not post
    solutions to the exercises anyplace where they can be found by
    search engines.

(** ** Downloading the Coq Files *)

(** A tar file containing the full sources for the "release version"
    of this book (as a collection of Coq scripts and HTML files) is
    available at https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu.

    (If you are using the book as part of a class, your professor may
    give you access to a locally modified version of the files, which
    you should use instead of the release version.) *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Lecture Videos *)

(** Lectures on for an intensive summer course based on some chapters
    of this book at the DeepSpec summer school in 2017 can be
    found at https://deepspec.org/event/dsss17/lecture_appel.html. *)

(** ** For Instructors and Contributors *)

(** If you plan to use these materials in your own course, you will
    undoubtedly find things you'd like to change, improve, or add.
    Your contributions are welcome!  Please see the [Preface]
    to _Logical Foundations_ for instructions. *)
