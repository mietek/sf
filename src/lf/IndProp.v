(** * Inductively Defined Propositions *)

(** In the [Logic] chapter, we looked at several ways of writing
    propositions, including conjunction, disjunction, and existential
    quantification.  In this chapter, we bring yet another new tool
    into the mix: _inductive definitions_.

    _Note_: For the sake of simplicity, most of this chapter uses an
    inductive definition of "evenness" as a running example.  You may
    find this confusing, since we already have a perfectly good way of
    defining evenness as a proposition ([n] is even if it is equal to
    the result of doubling some number); if so, rest assured that we
    will see many more compelling examples of inductively defined
    propositions toward the end of this chapter and in future
    chapters. *)

(** In past chapters, we have seen two ways of stating that a number
    [n] is even: We can say

      (1) [evenb n = true], or

      (2) [exists k, n = double k].

    Yet another possibility is to say that [n] is even if we can
    establish its evenness from the following rules:

       - Rule [ev_0]: The number [0] is even.
       - Rule [ev_SS]: If [n] is even, then [S (S n)] is even. *)

(** To illustrate how this new definition of evenness works,
    let's imagine using it to show that [4] is even. By rule [ev_SS],
    it suffices to show that [2] is even. This, in turn, is again
    guaranteed by rule [ev_SS], as long as we can show that [0] is
    even. But this last fact follows directly from the [ev_0] rule. *)

(** We will see many definitions like this one during the rest
    of the course.  For purposes of informal discussions, it is
    helpful to have a lightweight notation that makes them easy to
    read and write.  _Inference rules_ are one such notation.  (We'll
    use [ev] for the name of this property, since [even] is already
    used.)

                              ------------             (ev_0)
                                 ev 0

                                 ev n
                            ----------------          (ev_SS)
                             ev (S (S n))
*)

(** Each of the textual rules that we started with is
    reformatted here as an inference rule; the intended reading is
    that, if the _premises_ above the line all hold, then the
    _conclusion_ below the line follows.  For example, the rule
    [ev_SS] says that, if [n] satisfies [ev], then [S (S n)] also
    does.  If a rule has no premises above the line, then its
    conclusion holds unconditionally.

    We can represent a proof using these rules by combining rule
    applications into a _proof tree_. Here's how we might transcribe
    the above proof that [4] is even:

                             --------  (ev_0)
                              ev 0
                             -------- (ev_SS)
                              ev 2
                             -------- (ev_SS)
                              ev 4
*)

(** (Why call this a "tree", rather than a "stack", for example?
    Because, in general, inference rules can have multiple premises.
    We will see examples of this shortly.) *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Inductive Definition of Evenness *)

(** Putting all of this together, we can translate the definition of
    evenness into a formal Coq definition using an [Inductive]
    declaration, where each constructor corresponds to an inference
    rule: *)

Inductive ev : nat -> Prop :=
| ev_0 : ev 0
| ev_SS (n : nat) (H : ev n) : ev (S (S n)).

(** This definition is interestingly different from previous uses of
    [Inductive].  For one thing, we are defining not a [Type] (like
    [nat]) or a function yielding a [Type] (like [list]), but rather a
    function from [nat] to [Prop] -- that is, a property of numbers.
    But what is really new is that, because the [nat] argument of
    [ev] appears to the _right_ of the colon on the first line, it
    is allowed to take different values in the types of different
    constructors: [0] in the type of [ev_0] and [S (S n)] in the type
    of [ev_SS].  Accordingly, the type of each constructor must be
    specified explicitly (after a colon), and each constructor's type
    must have the form [ev n] for some natural number [n].

    In contrast, recall the definition of [list]:

    Inductive list (X:Type) : Type :=
      | nil
      | cons (x : X) (l : list X).

   This definition introduces the [X] parameter _globally_, to the
   _left_ of the colon, forcing the result of [nil] and [cons] to be
   the same (i.e., [list X]).  Had we tried to bring [nat] to the left
   of the colon in defining [ev], we would have seen an error: *)

Fail Inductive wrong_ev (n : nat) : Prop :=
| wrong_ev_0 : wrong_ev 0
| wrong_ev_SS (H: wrong_ev n) : wrong_ev (S (S n)).
(* ===> Error: Last occurrence of "[wrong_ev]" must have "[n]"
        as 1st argument in "[wrong_ev 0]". *)

(** In an [Inductive] definition, an argument to the type constructor
    on the left of the colon is called a "parameter", whereas an
    argument on the right is called an "index" or "annotation."

    For example, in [Inductive list (X : Type) := ...], the [X] is a
    parameter; in [Inductive ev : nat -> Prop := ...], the unnamed
    [nat] argument is an index. *)

(** We can think of the definition of [ev] as defining a Coq
    property [ev : nat -> Prop], together with "evidence constructors"
    [ev_0 : ev 0] and [ev_SS : forall n, ev n -> ev (S (S n))]. *)

(** Such "evidence constructors" have the same status as proven
    theorems.  In particular, we can use Coq's [apply] tactic with the
    rule names to prove [ev] for particular numbers... *)

Theorem ev_4 : ev 4.
Proof. apply ev_SS. apply ev_SS. apply ev_0. Qed.

(** ... or we can use function application syntax: *)

Theorem ev_4' : ev 4.
Proof. apply (ev_SS 2 (ev_SS 0 ev_0)). Qed.

(** We can also prove theorems that have hypotheses involving [ev]. *)

  apply ev_SS. apply ev_SS. apply Hn.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Using Evidence in Proofs *)

(** Besides _constructing_ evidence that numbers are even, we can also
    _destruct_ such evidence, which amounts to reasoning about how it
    could have been built.

    Introducing [ev] with an [Inductive] declaration tells Coq not
    only that the constructors [ev_0] and [ev_SS] are valid ways to
    build evidence that some number is [ev], but also that these two
    constructors are the _only_ ways to build evidence that numbers
    are [ev]. *)

(** In other words, if someone gives us evidence [E] for the assertion
    [ev n], then we know that [E] must be one of two things:

      - [E] is [ev_0] (and [n] is [O]), or
      - [E] is [ev_SS n' E'] (and [n] is [S (S n')], where [E'] is
        evidence for [ev n']). *)

(** This suggests that it should be possible to analyze a
    hypothesis of the form [ev n] much as we do inductively defined
    data structures; in particular, it should be possible to argue by
    _induction_ and _case analysis_ on such evidence.  Let's look at a
    few examples to see what this means in practice. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Inversion on Evidence *)

(** Suppose we are proving some fact involving a number [n], and
    we are given [ev n] as a hypothesis.  We already know how to
    perform case analysis on [n] using [destruct] or [induction],
    generating separate subgoals for the case where [n = O] and the
    case where [n = S n'] for some [n'].  But for some proofs we may
    instead want to analyze the evidence that [ev n] _directly_. As
    a tool, we can prove our characterization of evidence for
    [ev n], using [destruct]. *)

Theorem ev_inversion :
  forall (n : nat), ev n ->
    (n = 0) \/ (exists n', n = S (S n') /\ ev n').
Proof.
  intros n E.
  destruct E as [ | n' E'] eqn:EE.
  - (* E = ev_0 : ev 0 *)
    left. reflexivity.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E' : ev (S (S n')) *)
    right. exists n'. split. reflexivity. apply E'.
Qed.

(** The following theorem can easily be proved using [destruct] on
    evidence. *)

Theorem ev_minus2 : forall n,
  ev n -> ev (pred (pred n)).
Proof.
  intros n E.
  destruct E as [| n' E'] eqn:EE.
  - (* E = ev_0 *) simpl. apply ev_0.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E' *) simpl. apply E'.
Qed.

(** However, this variation cannot easily be handled with just
    [destruct]. *)

Theorem evSS_ev : forall n,
  ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.
(** Intuitively, we know that evidence for the hypothesis cannot
    consist just of the [ev_0] constructor, since [O] and [S] are
    different constructors of the type [nat]; hence, [ev_SS] is the
    only case that applies.  Unfortunately, [destruct] is not smart
    enough to realize this, and it still generates two subgoals.  Even
    worse, in doing so, it keeps the final goal unchanged, failing to
    provide any useful information for completing the proof.  *)
Proof.
  intros n E.
  destruct E as [| n' E'] eqn:EE.
  - (* E = ev_0. *)
    (* We must prove that [n] is even from no assumptions! *)
Abort.

(** What happened, exactly?  Calling [destruct] has the effect of
    replacing all occurrences of the property argument by the values
    that correspond to each constructor.  This is enough in the case
    of [ev_minus2] because that argument [n] is mentioned directly
    in the final goal. However, it doesn't help in the case of
    [evSS_ev] since the term that gets replaced ([S (S n)]) is not
    mentioned anywhere. *)

(** If we [remember] that term [S (S n)], the proof goes
    through.  (We'll discuss [remember] in more detail below.) *)

Theorem evSS_ev_remember : forall n,
  ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.
Proof.
  intros n E. remember (S (S n)) as k eqn:Hk. destruct E as [|n' E'] eqn:EE.
  - (* E = ev_0 *)
    (* Now we do have an assumption, in which [k = S (S n)] has been
       rewritten as [0 = S (S n)] by [destruct]. That assumption
       gives us a contradiction. *)
    discriminate Hk.
  - (* E = ev_S n' E' *)
    (* This time [k = S (S n)] has been rewritten as [S (S n') = S (S n)]. *)
    injection Hk as Heq. rewrite <- Heq. apply E'.
Qed.

(** Alternatively, the proof is straightforward using our inversion
    lemma. *)

Theorem evSS_ev : forall n, ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.
Proof.
 intros n H. apply ev_inversion in H.
 destruct H as [H0|H1].
 - discriminate H0.
 - destruct H1 as [n' [Hnm Hev]]. injection Hnm as Heq.
   rewrite Heq. apply Hev.
Qed.

(** Note how both proofs produce two subgoals, which correspond
    to the two ways of proving [ev].  The first subgoal is a
    contradiction that is discharged with [discriminate].  The second
    subgoal makes use of [injection] and [rewrite].  Coq provides a
    handy tactic called [inversion] that factors out that common
    pattern.

    The [inversion] tactic can detect (1) that the first case ([n =
    0]) does not apply and (2) that the [n'] that appears in the
    [ev_SS] case must be the same as [n].  It has an "[as]" variant
    similar to [destruct], allowing us to assign names rather than
    have Coq choose them. *)

Theorem evSS_ev' : forall n,
  ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.
Proof.
  intros n E.
  inversion E as [| n' E' Heq].
  (* We are in the [E = ev_SS n' E'] case now. *)
  apply E'.
Qed.

(** The [inversion] tactic can apply the principle of explosion to
    "obviously contradictory" hypotheses involving inductively defined
    properties, something that takes a bit more work using our
    inversion lemma. For example: *)

Theorem one_not_even : ~ ev 1.
Proof.
  intros H. apply ev_inversion in H.
  destruct H as [ | [m [Hm _]]].
  - discriminate H.
  - discriminate Hm.
Qed.

Theorem one_not_even' : ~ ev 1.
  intros H. inversion H. Qed.

(** [] *)

(** The [inversion] tactic does quite a bit of work. For
    example, when applied to an equality assumption, it does the work
    of both [discriminate] and [injection]. In addition, it carries
    out the [intros] and [rewrite]s that are typically necessary in
    the case of [injection]. It can also be applied, more generally,
    to analyze evidence for inductively defined propositions.  As
    examples, we'll use it to reprove some theorems from chapter
    [Tactics].  (Here we are being a bit lazy by omitting the [as]
    clause from [inversion], thereby asking Coq to choose names for
    the variables and hypotheses that it introduces.) *)

Theorem inversion_ex1 : forall (n m o : nat),
  [n; m] = [o; o] ->
  [n] = [m].
Proof.
  intros n m o H. inversion H. reflexivity. Qed.

Theorem inversion_ex2 : forall (n : nat),
  S n = O ->
  2 + 2 = 5.
Proof.
  intros n contra. inversion contra. Qed.

(** Here's how [inversion] works in general.  Suppose the name
    [H] refers to an assumption [P] in the current context, where [P]
    has been defined by an [Inductive] declaration.  Then, for each of
    the constructors of [P], [inversion H] generates a subgoal in which
    [H] has been replaced by the exact, specific conditions under
    which this constructor could have been used to prove [P].  Some of
    these subgoals will be self-contradictory; [inversion] throws
    these away.  The ones that are left represent the cases that must
    be proved to establish the original goal.  For those, [inversion]
    adds all equations into the proof context that must hold of the
    arguments given to [P] (e.g., [S (S n') = n] in the proof of
    [evSS_ev]). *)

(** The [ev_double] exercise above shows that our new notion of
    evenness is implied by the two earlier ones (since, by
    [even_bool_prop] in chapter [Logic], we already know that
    those are equivalent to each other). To show that all three
    coincide, we just need the following lemma. *)

Lemma ev_even_firsttry : forall n,
  ev n -> even n.
Proof.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)

(** We could try to proceed by case analysis or induction on [n].  But
    since [ev] is mentioned in a premise, this strategy would
    probably lead to a dead end, because (as we've noted before) the
    induction hypothesis will talk about n-1 (which is _not_ even!).
    Thus, it seems better to first try [inversion] on the evidence for
    [ev].  Indeed, the first case can be solved trivially. And we can
    seemingly make progress on the second case with a helper lemma. *)

  intros n E. inversion E as [EQ' | n' E' EQ'].
  - (* E = ev_0 *)
    exists 0. reflexivity.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E' *) simpl.

(** Unfortunately, the second case is harder.  We need to show [exists
    k, S (S n') = double k], but the only available assumption is
    [E'], which states that [ev n'] holds.  Since this isn't
    directly useful, it seems that we are stuck and that performing
    case analysis on [E] was a waste of time.

    If we look more closely at our second goal, however, we can see
    that something interesting happened: By performing case analysis
    on [E], we were able to reduce the original result to a similar
    one that involves a _different_ piece of evidence for [ev]:
    namely [E'].  More formally, we can finish our proof by showing
    that

        exists k', n' = double k',

    which is the same as the original statement, but with [n'] instead
    of [n].  Indeed, it is not difficult to convince Coq that this
    intermediate result suffices. *)

    (** Unforunately, now we are stuck. To make that apparent, let's move
        [E'] back into the goal from the hypotheses. *)

    generalize dependent E'.

    (** Now it is clear we are trying to prove another instance of the
        same theorem we set out to prove.  This instance is with [n'],
        instead of [n], where [n'] is a smaller natural number than [n]. *)
Abort.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Induction on Evidence *)

(** If this looks familiar, it is no coincidence: We've encountered
    similar problems in the [Induction] chapter, when trying to
    use case analysis to prove results that required induction.  And
    once again the solution is... induction! *)

(** The behavior of [induction] on evidence is the same as its
    behavior on data: It causes Coq to generate one subgoal for each
    constructor that could have used to build that evidence, while
    providing an induction hypothesis for each recursive occurrence of
    the property in question.

    To prove a property of [n] holds for all numbers for which [ev
    n] holds, we can use induction on [ev n]. This requires us to
    prove two things, corresponding to the two ways in which [ev n]
    could have been constructed. If it was constructed by [ev_0], then
    [n=0], and the property must hold of [0]. If it was constructed by
    [ev_SS], then the evidence of [ev n] is of the form [ev_SS n'
    E'], where [n = S (S n')] and [E'] is evidence for [ev n']. In
    this case, the inductive hypothesis says that the property we are
    trying to prove holds for [n']. *)

(** Let's try our current lemma again: *)

Lemma ev_even : forall n,
  ev n -> even n.
Proof.
  intros n E.
  induction E as [|n' E' IH].
  - (* E = ev_0 *)
    exists 0. reflexivity.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E'
       with IH : even E' *)
    unfold even in IH.
    destruct IH as [k Hk].
    rewrite Hk. exists (S k). simpl. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Here, we can see that Coq produced an [IH] that corresponds
    to [E'], the single recursive occurrence of [ev] in its own
    definition.  Since [E'] mentions [n'], the induction hypothesis
    talks about [n'], as opposed to [n] or some other number. *)

(** The equivalence between the second and third definitions of
    evenness now follows. *)

Theorem ev_even_iff : forall n,
  ev n <-> even n.
Proof.
  intros n. split.
  - (* -> *) apply ev_even.
  - (* <- *) unfold even. intros [k Hk]. rewrite Hk. apply ev_double.
Qed.

(** As we will see in later chapters, induction on evidence is a
    recurring technique across many areas, and in particular when
    formalizing the semantics of programming languages, where many
    properties of interest are defined inductively. *)

(** The following exercises provide simple examples of this
    technique, to help you familiarize yourself with it. *)

(** * Inductive Relations *)

(** A proposition parameterized by a number (such as [ev])
    can be thought of as a _property_ -- i.e., it defines
    a subset of [nat], namely those numbers for which the proposition
    is provable.  In the same way, a two-argument proposition can be
    thought of as a _relation_ -- i.e., it defines a set of pairs for
    which the proposition is provable. *)

Module Playground.

(** Just like properties, relations can be defined inductively.  One
    useful example is the "less than or equal to" relation on
    numbers. *)

(** The following definition should be fairly intuitive.  It
    says that there are two ways to give evidence that one number is
    less than or equal to another: either observe that they are the
    same number, or give evidence that the first is less than or equal
    to the predecessor of the second. *)

Inductive le : nat -> nat -> Prop :=
  | le_n (n : nat)                : le n n
  | le_S (n m : nat) (H : le n m) : le n (S m).

Notation "n <= m" := (le n m).

(** Proofs of facts about [<=] using the constructors [le_n] and
    [le_S] follow the same patterns as proofs about properties, like
    [ev] above. We can [apply] the constructors to prove [<=]
    goals (e.g., to show that [3<=3] or [3<=6]), and we can use
    tactics like [inversion] to extract information from [<=]
    hypotheses in the context (e.g., to prove that [(2 <= 1) ->
    2+2=5].) *)

(** Here are some sanity checks on the definition.  (Notice that,
    although these are the same kind of simple "unit tests" as we gave
    for the testing functions we wrote in the first few lectures, we
    must construct their proofs explicitly -- [simpl] and
    [reflexivity] don't do the job, because the proofs aren't just a
    matter of simplifying computations.) *)

(** * Case Study: Regular Expressions *)

(** The [ev] property provides a simple example for
    illustrating inductive definitions and the basic techniques for
    reasoning about them, but it is not terribly exciting -- after
    all, it is equivalent to the two non-inductive definitions of
    evenness that we had already seen, and does not seem to offer any
    concrete benefit over them.

    To give a better sense of the power of inductive definitions, we
    now show how to use them to model a classic concept in computer
    science: _regular expressions_. *)

(** Regular expressions are a simple language for describing sets of
    strings.  Their syntax is defined as follows: *)

Inductive reg_exp (T : Type) : Type :=
  | EmptySet
  | EmptyStr
  | Char (t : T)
  | App (r1 r2 : reg_exp T)
  | Union (r1 r2 : reg_exp T)
  | Star (r : reg_exp T).

Arguments EmptySet {T}.
Arguments EmptyStr {T}.
Arguments Char {T} _.
Arguments App {T} _ _.
Arguments Union {T} _ _.
Arguments Star {T} _.

(** Note that this definition is _polymorphic_: Regular
    expressions in [reg_exp T] describe strings with characters drawn
    from [T] -- that is, lists of elements of [T].

    (We depart slightly from standard practice in that we do not
    require the type [T] to be finite.  This results in a somewhat
    different theory of regular expressions, but the difference is not
    significant for our purposes.) *)

(** We connect regular expressions and strings via the following
    rules, which define when a regular expression _matches_ some
    string:

      - The expression [EmptySet] does not match any string.

      - The expression [EmptyStr] matches the empty string [[]].

      - The expression [Char x] matches the one-character string [[x]].

      - If [re1] matches [s1], and [re2] matches [s2],
        then [App re1 re2] matches [s1 ++ s2].

      - If at least one of [re1] and [re2] matches [s],
        then [Union re1 re2] matches [s].

      - Finally, if we can write some string [s] as the concatenation
        of a sequence of strings [s = s_1 ++ ... ++ s_k], and the
        expression [re] matches each one of the strings [s_i],
        then [Star re] matches [s].

        In particular, the sequence of strings may be empty, so
        [Star re] always matches the empty string [[]] no matter what
        [re] is. *)

(** We can easily translate this informal definition into an
    [Inductive] one as follows.  We use the notation [s =~ re] in
    place of [exp_match s re]; by "reserving" the notation before
    defining the [Inductive], we can use it in the definition! *)

Reserved Notation "s =~ re" (at level 80).

*)

(** Notice that these rules are not _quite_ the same as the
    informal ones that we gave at the beginning of the section.
    First, we don't need to include a rule explicitly stating that no
    string matches [EmptySet]; we just don't happen to include any
    rule that would have the effect of some string matching
    [EmptySet].  (Indeed, the syntax of inductive definitions doesn't
    even _allow_ us to give such a "negative rule.")

    Second, the informal rules for [Union] and [Star] correspond
    to two constructors each: [MUnionL] / [MUnionR], and [MStar0] /
    [MStarApp].  The result is logically equivalent to the original
    rules but more convenient to use in Coq, since the recursive
    occurrences of [exp_match] are given as direct arguments to the
    constructors, making it easier to perform induction on evidence.
    (The [exp_match_ex1] and [exp_match_ex2] exercises below ask you
    to prove that the constructors given in the inductive declaration
    and the ones that would arise from a more literal transcription of
    the informal rules are indeed equivalent.)

    Let's illustrate these rules with a few examples. *)

Example reg_exp_ex1 : [1] =~ Char 1.
Proof.
  apply MChar.
Qed.

Example reg_exp_ex2 : [1; 2] =~ App (Char 1) (Char 2).
Proof.
  apply (MApp [1]).
  - apply MChar.
  - apply MChar.
Qed.

(** (Notice how the last example applies [MApp] to the string
    [[1]] directly.  Since the goal mentions [[1; 2]] instead of 
    [[1] ++ [2]], Coq wouldn't be able to figure out how to split 
    the string on its own.)

    Using [inversion], we can also show that certain strings do _not_
    match a regular expression: *)

Example reg_exp_ex3 : ~ ([1; 2] =~ Char 1).
Proof.
  intros H. inversion H.
Qed.

(** We can define helper functions for writing down regular
    expressions. The [reg_exp_of_list] function constructs a regular
    expression that matches exactly the list that it receives as an
    argument: *)

Fixpoint reg_exp_of_list {T} (l : list T) :=
  match l with
  | [] => EmptyStr
  | x :: l' => App (Char x) (reg_exp_of_list l')
  end.

Example reg_exp_ex4 : [1; 2; 3] =~ reg_exp_of_list [1; 2; 3].
Proof.
  simpl. apply (MApp [1]).
  { apply MChar. }
  apply (MApp [2]).
  { apply MChar. }
  apply (MApp [3]).
  { apply MChar. }
  apply MEmpty.
Qed.

(** We can also prove general facts about [exp_match].  For instance,
    the following lemma shows that every string [s] that matches [re]
    also matches [Star re]. *)

Lemma MStar1 :
  forall T s (re : reg_exp T) ,
    s =~ re ->
    s =~ Star re.

    exactly the same shape expected by [MStarApp].) *)

(** Since the definition of [exp_match] has a recursive
    structure, we might expect that proofs involving regular
    expressions will often require induction on evidence. *)

(** For example, suppose that we wanted to prove the following
    intuitive result: If a regular expression [re] matches some string
    [s], then all elements of [s] must occur as character literals
    somewhere in [re].

    To state this theorem, we first define a function [re_chars] that
    lists all characters that occur in a regular expression: *)

Fixpoint re_chars {T} (re : reg_exp T) : list T :=

  | EmptyStr => []

  | App re1 re2 => re_chars re1 ++ re_chars re2
  | Union re1 re2 => re_chars re1 ++ re_chars re2
  | Star re => re_chars re
  end.

(** We can then phrase our theorem as follows: *)

(** ** The [remember] Tactic *)

(** One potentially confusing feature of the [induction] tactic is
    that it will let you try to perform an induction over a term that
    isn't sufficiently general.  The effect of this is to lose
    information (much as [destruct] without an [eqn:] clause can do),
    and leave you unable to complete the proof.  Here's an example: *)

Lemma star_app: forall T (s1 s2 : list T) (re : reg_exp T),
  s1 =~ Star re ->
  s2 =~ Star re ->
  s1 ++ s2 =~ Star re.
Proof.
  intros T s1 s2 re H1.

(** Just doing an [inversion] on [H1] won't get us very far in
    the recursive cases. (Try it!). So we need induction (on
    evidence!). Here is a naive first attempt: *)

  generalize dependent s2.
  induction H1

        |s1 re1 re2 Hmatch IH|re1 s2' re2 Hmatch IH
        |re''|s1 s2' re'' Hmatch1 IH1 Hmatch2 IH2].

(** But now, although we get seven cases (as we would expect from the
    definition of [exp_match]), we have lost a very important bit of
    information from [H1]: the fact that [s1] matched something of the
    form [Star re].  This means that we have to give proofs for _all_
    seven constructors of this definition, even though all but two of
    them ([MStar0] and [MStarApp]) are contradictory.  We can still
    get the proof to go through for a few constructors, such as
    [MEmpty]... *)

  - (* MEmpty *)
    simpl. intros s2 H. apply H.

(** ... but most cases get stuck.  For [MChar], for instance, we
    must show that

    s2 =~ Char x' -> x' :: s2 =~ Char x',

    which is clearly impossible. *)

  - (* MChar. *) intros s2 H. simpl. (* Stuck... *)
Abort.

(** The problem is that [induction] over a Prop hypothesis only works
    properly with hypotheses that are completely general, i.e., ones
    in which all the arguments are variables, as opposed to more
    complex expressions, such as [Star re].

    (In this respect, [induction] on evidence behaves more like
    [destruct]-without-[eqn:] than like [inversion].)

    An awkward way to solve this problem is "manually generalizing"
    over the problematic expressions by adding explicit equality
    hypotheses to the lemma: *)

Lemma star_app: forall T (s1 s2 : list T) (re re' : reg_exp T),
  re' = Star re ->
  s1 =~ re' ->
  s2 =~ Star re ->
  s1 ++ s2 =~ Star re.

(** We can now proceed by performing induction over evidence directly,
    because the argument to the first hypothesis is sufficiently
    general, which means that we can discharge most cases by inverting
    the [re' = Star re] equality in the context.

    This idiom is so common that Coq provides a tactic to
    automatically generate such equations for us, avoiding thus the
    need for changing the statements of our theorems. *)

(** **** Exercise: 5 stars, advanced (weak_pumping) 

    One of the first really interesting theorems in the theory of
    regular expressions is the so-called _pumping lemma_, which
    states, informally, that any sufficiently long string [s] matching
    a regular expression [re] can be "pumped" by repeating some middle
    section of [s] an arbitrary number of times to produce a new
    string also matching [re].  (For the sake of simplicity in this
    exercise, we consider a slightly weaker theorem than is usually
    stated in courses on automata theory.)

    To get started, we need to define "sufficiently long."  Since we
    are working in a constructive logic, we actually need to be able
    to calculate, for each regular expression [re], the minimum length
    for strings [s] to guarantee "pumpability." *)

Module Pumping.

  | Union re1 re2 =>

(** The (weak) pumping lemma itself says that, if [s =~ re] and if the

    that [s2] can be repeated any number of times and the result, when
    combined with [s1] and [s3] will still match [re].  Since [s2] is
    also guaranteed not to be the empty string, this gives us
    a (constructive!) way to generate strings matching [re] that are

(** We've seen in the [Logic] chapter that we often need to

    performing this conversion as we did it there can result in
    tedious proof scripts.  Consider the proof of the following
    theorem: *)

Theorem filter_not_empty_In : forall n l,

(** In the first branch after [destruct], we explicitly apply

(** We can streamline this by defining an inductive proposition that
    yields a better case-analysis principle for [n =? m].

    right away the assumption we really need: [n = m]. *)

Inductive reflect (P : Prop) : bool -> Prop :=
| ReflectT (H :   P) : reflect P true
| ReflectF (H : ~ P) : reflect P false.

(** The [reflect] property takes two arguments: a proposition
    [P] and a boolean [b].  Intuitively, it states that the property
    [P] is _reflected_ in (i.e., equivalent to) the boolean [b]: that
    is, [P] holds if and only if [b = true].  To see this, notice
    that, by definition, the only way we can produce evidence for
    [reflect P true] is by showing [P] and then using the [ReflectT]
    constructor.  If we invert this statement, this means that it
    should be possible to extract evidence for [P] from a proof of
    [reflect P true].  Similarly, the only way to show [reflect P
    false] is by combining evidence for [~ P] with the [ReflectF]
    constructor.

    It is easy to formalize this intuition and show that the
    statements [P <-> b = true] and [reflect P b] are indeed
    equivalent.  First, the left-to-right implication: *)

Theorem iff_reflect : forall P b, (P <-> b = true) -> reflect P b.

(** The advantage of [reflect] over the normal "if and only if"

    branches ([P] in the first subgoal and [~ P] in the second). *)

    [filter_not_empty_In] with Coq and observe the differences in

    specification, written out informally in English:

    A list [l] is an "in-order merge" of [l1] and [l2] if it contains
    all the same elements as [l1] and [l2], in the same order as [l1]
    and [l2], but possibly interleaved.  For example,

    [1;4;6;2;3]

    is an in-order merge of

    [1;6;2]

    and

    [4;3].

    Now, suppose we have a set [X], a function [test: X->bool], and a
    list [l] of type [list X].  Suppose further that [l] is an
    in-order merge of two lists, [l1] and [l2], such that every item
    in [l1] satisfies [test] and no item in [l2] satisfies test.  Then
    [filter test l = l1].

    Translate this specification into a Coq theorem and prove

(** ** Extended Exercise: A Verified Regular-Expression Matcher *)

(** We have now defined a match relation over regular expressions and
    polymorphic lists. We can use such a definition to manually prove that
    a given regex matches a given string, but it does not give us a
    program that we can run to determine a match autmatically.

    It would be reasonable to hope that we can translate the definitions
    of the inductive rules for constructing evidence of the match relation
    into cases of a recursive function that reflects the relation by recursing
    on a given regex. However, it does not seem straightforward to define
    such a function in which the given regex is a recursion variable
    recognized by Coq. As a result, Coq will not accept that the function
    always terminates.

    Heavily-optimized regex matchers match a regex by translating a given
    regex into a state machine and determining if the state machine
    accepts a given string. However, regex matching can also be
    implemented using an algorithm that operates purely on strings and
    regexes without defining and maintaining additional datatypes, such as
    state machines. We'll implemement such an algorithm, and verify that
    its value reflects the match relation. *)

(** We will implement a regex matcher that matches strings represented
    as lists of ASCII characters: *)
Require Import Coq.Strings.Ascii.

Definition string := list ascii.

(** The Coq standard library contains a distinct inductive definition
    of strings of ASCII characters. However, we will use the above
    definition of strings as lists as ASCII characters in order to apply
    the existing definition of the match relation.

    We could also define a regex matcher over polymorphic lists, not lists
    of ASCII characters specifically. The matching algorithm that we will
    implement needs to be able to test equality of elements in a given
    list, and thus needs to be given an equality-testing
    function. Generalizing the definitions, theorems, and proofs that we
    define for such a setting is a bit tedious, but workable. *)

(** The proof of correctness of the regex matcher will combine
    properties of the regex-matching function with properties of the
    [match] relation that do not depend on the matching function. We'll go
    ahead and prove the latter class of properties now. Most of them have
    straightforward proofs, which have been given to you, although there
    are a few key lemmas that are left for you to prove. *)

    [a::s] matches [Star re] iff [s = s0 ++ s1], where [a::s0] matches
    [re] and [s1] matches [Star re]. Like [app_ne], this observation is
    critical, so understand it, prove it, and keep it in mind.

    Hint: you'll need to perform induction. There are quite a few
    reasonable candidates for [Prop]'s to prove by induction. The only one
    that will work is splitting the [iff] into two implications and
    proving one by induction on the evidence for [a :: s =~ Star re]. The
    other implication can be proved without induction.

    In order to prove the right property by induction, you'll need to
    rephrase [a :: s =~ Star re] to be a [Prop] over general variables,
    using the [remember] tactic.  *)

(** The definition of our regex matcher will include two fixpoint

    Now, prove that [match_eps] indeed tests if a given regex matches

(** We'll define other functions that use [match_eps]. However, the

(** The key operation that will be performed by our regex matcher will
    be to iteratively construct a sequence of regex derivatives. For each
    character [a] and regex [re], the derivative of [re] on [a] is a regex
    that matches all suffixes of strings matched by [re] that start with
    [a]. I.e., [re'] is a derivative of [re] on [a] if they satisfy the
    following relation: *)

Definition is_der re (a : ascii) re' :=
  forall s, a :: s =~ re <-> s =~ re'.

(** A function [d] derives strings if, given character [a] and regex
    [re], it evaluates to the derivative of [re] on [a]. I.e., [d]
    satisfies the following property: *)
Definition derives d := forall a re, is_der re a (d a re).

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard, optional (derive)

(** The [derive] function should pass the following tests. Each test

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, standard, optional (derive_corr) 

    Prove that [derive] in fact always derives strings.

    Hint: one proof performs induction on [re], although you'll need
    to carefully choose the property that you prove by induction by
    generalizing the appropriate terms.

    Hint: if your definition of [derive] applies [match_eps] to a
    particular regex [re], then a natural proof will apply
    [match_eps_refl] to [re] and destruct the result to generate cases
    with assumptions that the [re] does or does not match the empty
    string.

    Hint: You can save quite a bit of work by using lemmas proved
    above. In particular, to prove many cases of the induction, you
    can rewrite a [Prop] over a complicated regex (e.g., [s =~ Union
    re0 re1]) to a Boolean combination of [Prop]'s over simple
    regex's (e.g., [s =~ re0 \/ s =~ re1]) using lemmas given above
    that are logical equivalences. You can then reason about these
    [Prop]'s naturally using [intro] and [destruct]. *)

(** A function [m] matches regexes if, given string [s] and regex [re],

    Finally, prove that [regex_match] in fact matches regexes.

    Hint: if your definition of [regex_match] applies [match_eps] to
    regex [re], then a natural proof applies [match_eps_refl] to [re]
    and destructs the result to generate cases in which you may assume
    that [re] does or does not match the empty string.

    Hint: if your definition of [regex_match] applies [derive] to
    character [x] and regex [re], then a natural proof applies
    [derive_corr] to [x] and [re] to prove that [x :: s =~ re] given
    [s =~ derive x re], and vice versa. *)
