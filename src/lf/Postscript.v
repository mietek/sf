(** Congratulations: We've made it to the end! *)

(** * Looking Back *)

(** We've covered quite a bit of ground so far.  Here's a quick review...

   - _Functional programming_:
          - "declarative" programming style (recursion over immutable
            data structures, rather than looping over mutable arrays
            or pointer structures)
          - higher-order functions
          - polymorphism *)

(**
     - _Logic_, the mathematical basis for software engineering:

               logic                        calculus
        --------------------   ~   ----------------------------
        software engineering       mechanical/civil engineering

          - inductively defined sets and relations
          - inductive proofs
          - proof objects *)

(**
     - _Coq_, an industrial-strength proof assistant
          - functional core language
          - core tactics
          - automation
*)

(** * Looking Forward *)

(** If what you've seen so far has whetted your interest, you have two
    choices for further reading in the _Software Foundations_ series:

           - _Programming Language Foundations_ (volume 2, by a set of
             authors similar to this book's) covers material that
             might be found in a graduate course on the theory of
             programming languages, including Hoare logic, operational
             semantics, and type systems.

           - _Verified Functional Algorithms_ (volume 3, by Andrew
             Appel) builds on the themes of functional programming and
             program verification in Coq, addressing a range of topics
             that might be found in a standard data structures course,
             with an eye to formal verification. *)

(** * Resources *)

(** Here are some other good places to learn more...

       - This book includes some optional chapters covering topics
         that you may find useful.  Take a look at the table of contents and the chapter dependency diagram to find
         them.

       - For questions about Coq, the [#coq] area of Stack
         Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/coq)
         is an excellent community resource.

       - Here are some great books on functional programming
            - Learn You a Haskell for Great Good, by Miran Lipovaca
              [Lipovaca 2011] (in Bib.v).
            - Real World Haskell, by Bryan O'Sullivan, John Goerzen,
              and Don Stewart [O'Sullivan 2008] (in Bib.v)
            - ...and many other excellent books on Haskell, OCaml,
              Scheme, Racket, Scala, F sharp, etc., etc.

       - And some further resources for Coq:
           - Certified Programming with Dependent Types, by Adam
             Chlipala [Chlipala 2013] (in Bib.v).
           - Interactive Theorem Proving and Program Development:
             Coq'Art: The Calculus of Inductive Constructions, by Yves
             Bertot and Pierre Casteran [Bertot 2004] (in Bib.v).

       - If you're interested in real-world applications of formal
         verification to critical software, see the Postscript chapter
         of _Programming Language Foundations_.

       - For applications of Coq in building verified systems, the
         lectures and course materials for the 2017 DeepSpec Summer
         School are a great resource.
