<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 This is the entry point to a series of electronic textbooks on
    various aspects of <i>Software Foundations</i>, the mathematical
    underpinnings of reliable software.  Topics in the series include
    basic concepts of logic, computer-assisted theorem proving, the
    Coq proof assistant, functional programming, operational
    semantics, logics and techniques for reasoning about programs,
    static type systems, property-based random testing, and
    verification of practical C code.  The exposition is intended for
    a broad range of readers, from advanced undergraduates to PhD
    students and researchers.  No specific background in logic or
    programming languages is assumed, though a degree of mathematical
    maturity will be helpful.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The principal novelty of the series is that it is one hundred
    percent formalized and machine-checked: each text is literally a
    script for Coq.  The books are intended to be read alongside (or
    inside) an interactive session with Coq.  All the details in the
    text are fully formalized in Coq, and most of the exercises are
    designed to be worked using Coq.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The files in each book are organized into a sequence of core
    chapters, covering about one semester's worth of material and
    organized into a coherent linear narrative, plus a number of
    "offshoot" chapters covering additional topics.  All the core
    chapters are suitable for both upper-level undergraduate and
    graduate students.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    This book, <i>Logical Foundations</i>, lays groundwork for the others,
    introducing the reader to the basic ideas of functional
    programming, constructive logic, and the Coq proof assistant.

<a id="lab2"></a><h1 class="section">Overview</h1>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Building reliable software is really hard -- really hard.  The
    scale and complexity of modern systems, the number of people
    involved, and the range of demands placed on them make it
    challenging to build software that is even more-or-less correct,
    much less 100% correct.  At the same time, the increasing degree
    to which information processing is woven into every aspect of
    society greatly amplifies the cost of bugs and insecurities.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Computer scientists and software engineers have responded to these
    challenges by developing a host of techniques for improving
    software reliability, ranging from recommendations about managing
    software projects teams (e.g., extreme programming) to design
    philosophies for libraries (e.g., model-view-controller,
    publish-subscribe, etc.) and programming languages (e.g.,
    object-oriented programming, aspect-oriented programming,
    functional programming, ...) to mathematical techniques for
    specifying and reasoning about properties of software and tools
    for helping validate these properties.  The <i>Software Foundations</i>
    series is focused on this last set of tools.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    This volume weaves together three conceptual threads:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    (1) basic tools from <i>logic</i> for making and justifying precise
        claims about programs;

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    (2) the use of <i>proof assistants</i> to construct rigorous logical
        arguments;

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    (3) <i>functional programming</i>, both as a method of programming that
        simplifies reasoning about programs and as a bridge between
        programming and logic. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab3"></a><h2 class="section">Logic</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Logic is the field of study whose subject matter is <i>proofs</i> --
    unassailable arguments for the truth of particular propositions.
    Volumes have been written about the central role of logic in
    computer science.  Manna and Waldinger called it "the calculus of
    computer science," while Halpern et al.'s paper <i>On the Unusual
    Effectiveness of Logic in Computer Science</i> catalogs scores of
    ways in which logic offers critical tools and insights.  Indeed,
    they observe that, "As a matter of fact, logic has turned out to
    be significantly more effective in computer science than it has
    been in mathematics.  This is quite remarkable, especially since
    much of the impetus for the development of logic during the past
    one hundred years came from mathematics."

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    In particular, the fundamental tools of <i>inductive proof</i> are
    ubiquitous in all of computer science.  You have surely seen them
    before, perhaps in a course on discrete math or analysis of
    algorithms, but in this course we will examine them more deeply
    than you have probably done so far. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab4"></a><h2 class="section">Proof Assistants</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The flow of ideas between logic and computer science has not been
    unidirectional: CS has also made important contributions to logic.
    One of these has been the development of software tools for
    helping construct proofs of logical propositions.  These tools
    fall into two broad categories:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> <i>Automated theorem provers</i> provide "push-button" operation:
         you give them a proposition and they return either <i>true</i> or
         <i>false</i> (or, sometimes, <i>don't know: ran out of time</i>).
         Although their capabilities are still limited to specific
         domains, they have matured tremendously in recent years and
         are used now in a multitude of settings.  Examples of such
         tools include SAT solvers, SMT solvers, and model checkers.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> <i>Proof assistants</i> are hybrid tools that automate the more
         routine aspects of building proofs while depending on human
         guidance for more difficult aspects.  Widely used proof
         assistants include Isabelle, Agda, Twelf, ACL2, PVS, and Coq,
         among many others.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    This course is based around Coq, a proof assistant that has been
    under development since 1983 and that in recent years has
    attracted a large community of users in both research and
    industry.  Coq provides a rich environment for interactive
    development of machine-checked formal reasoning.  The kernel of
    the Coq system is a simple proof-checker, which guarantees that
    only correct deduction steps are ever performed.  On top of this
    kernel, the Coq environment provides high-level facilities for
    proof development, including a large library of common definitions
    and lemmas, powerful tactics for constructing complex proofs
    semi-automatically, and a special-purpose programming language for
    defining new proof-automation tactics for specific situations.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Coq has been a critical enabler for a huge variety of work across
    computer science and mathematics:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> As a <i>platform for modeling programming languages</i>, it has
      become a standard tool for researchers who need to describe and
      reason about complex language definitions.  It has been used,
      for example, to check the security of the JavaCard platform,
      obtaining the highest level of common criteria certification,
      and for formal specifications of the x<sub>86</sub> and LLVM instruction
      sets and programming languages such as C.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> As an <i>environment for developing formally certified software
      and hardware</i>, Coq has been used, for example, to build
      CompCert, a fully-verified optimizing compiler for C, and
      CertiKOS, a fully verified hypervisor, for proving the
      correctness of subtle algorithms involving floating point
      numbers, and as the basis for CertiCrypt, an environment for
      reasoning about the security of cryptographic algorithms.  It is
      also being used to build verified implementations of the
      open-source RISC-V processor architecture.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> As a <i>realistic environment for functional programming with
      dependent types</i>, it has inspired numerous innovations.  For
      example, the Ynot system embeds "relational Hoare reasoning" (an
      extension of the <i>Hoare Logic</i> we will see later in this course)
      in Coq.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> As a <i>proof assistant for higher-order logic</i>, it has been used
      to validate a number of important results in mathematics.  For
      example, its ability to include complex computations inside
      proofs made it possible to develop the first formally verified
      proof of the 4-color theorem.  This proof had previously been
      controversial among mathematicians because it required checking
      a large number of configurations using a program. In the Coq
      formalization, everything is checked, including the correctness
      of the computational part.  More recently, an even more massive
      effort led to a Coq formalization of the Feit-Thompson Theorem,
      the first major step in the classification of finite simple
      groups.

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

   By the way, in case you're wondering about the name, here's what
   the official Coq web site at INRIA (the French national research
   lab where Coq has mostly been developed) says about it: "Some
   French computer scientists have a tradition of naming their
   software as animal species: Caml, Elan, Foc or Phox are examples of
   this tacit convention. In French, 'coq' means rooster, and it
   sounds like the initials of the Calculus of Constructions (CoC) on
   which it is based."  The rooster is also the national symbol of
   France, and C-o-q are the first three letters of the name of
   Thierry Coquand, one of Coq's early developers. 
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab5"></a><h2 class="section">Functional Programming</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The term <i>functional programming</i> refers both to a collection of
    programming idioms that can be used in almost any programming
    language and to a family of programming languages designed to
    emphasize these idioms, including Haskell, OCaml, Standard ML,
    F#, Scala, Scheme, Racket, Common Lisp, Clojure, Erlang, and Coq.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Functional programming has been developed over many decades --
    indeed, its roots go back to Church's lambda-calculus, which was
    invented in the 1930s, well <i>before</i> the first electronic
    computers!  But since the early '90s it has enjoyed a surge of
    interest among industrial engineers and language designers,
    playing a key role in high-value systems at companies like Jane
    Street Capital, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, and Ericsson.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The most basic tenet of functional programming is that, as much as
    possible, computation should be <i>pure</i>, in the sense that the only
    effect of execution should be to produce a result: it should be
    free from <i>side effects</i> such as I/O, assignments to mutable
    variables, redirecting pointers, etc.  For example, whereas an
    <i>imperative</i> sorting function might take a list of numbers and
    rearrange its pointers to put the list in order, a pure sorting
    function would take the original list and return a <i>new</i> list
    containing the same numbers in sorted order.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    A significant benefit of this style of programming is that it
    makes programs easier to understand and reason about.  If every
    operation on a data structure yields a new data structure, leaving
    the old one intact, then there is no need to worry about how that
    structure is being shared and whether a change by one part of the
    program might break an invariant relied on by another part of the
    program.  These considerations are particularly critical in
    concurrent systems, where every piece of mutable state that is
    shared between threads is a potential source of pernicious bugs.
    Indeed, a large part of the recent interest in functional
    programming in industry is due to its simpler behavior in the
    presence of concurrency.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Another reason for the current excitement about functional
    programming is related to the first: functional programs are often
    much easier to parallelize and physically distribute than their
    imperative counterparts.  If running a computation has no effect
    other than producing a result, then it does not matter <i>where</i> it
    is run.  Similarly, if a data structure is never modified
    destructively, then it can be copied freely, across cores or
    across the network.  Indeed, the "Map-Reduce" idiom, which lies at
    the heart of massively distributed query processors like Hadoop
    and is used by Google to index the entire web is a classic example
    of functional programming.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    For purposes of this course, functional programming has yet
    another significant attraction: it serves as a bridge between
    logic and computer science.  Indeed, Coq itself can be viewed as a
    combination of a small but extremely expressive functional
    programming language plus a set of tools for stating and proving
    logical assertions.  Moreover, when we come to look more closely,
    we find that these two sides of Coq are actually aspects of the
    very same underlying machinery -- i.e., <i>proofs are programs</i>.

 Coq runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.  You will need:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> A current installation of Coq, available from the Coq home page.
      These files have been tested with Coq 8.12.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> An IDE for interacting with Coq.  Currently, there are two
      choices:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> Proof General is an Emacs-based IDE.  It tends to be
          preferred by users who are already comfortable with Emacs.
          It requires a separate installation (google "Proof
          General").

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

          Adventurous users of Coq within Emacs may want to check
          out extensions such as <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">company</span>-<span class="id" title="var">coq</span></span> and <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">control</span>-<span class="id" title="var">lock</span></span>.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> CoqIDE is a simpler stand-alone IDE.  It is distributed with
          Coq, so it should be available once you have Coq installed.
          It can also be compiled from scratch, but on some platforms
          this may involve installing additional packages for GUI
          libraries and such.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

          Users who like CoqIDE should consider running it with the
          "asynchronous" and "error resilience" modes disabled:

</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<a id="lab9"></a><h2 class="section">Exercises</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Each chapter includes numerous exercises.  Each is marked with a
    "star rating," which can be interpreted as follows:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> One star: easy exercises that underscore points in the text
         and that, for most readers, should take only a minute or two.
         Get in the habit of working these as you reach them.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Two stars: straightforward exercises (five or ten minutes).

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Three stars: exercises requiring a bit of thought (ten
         minutes to half an hour).

<div class="paragraph"> </div>


</li>
<li> Four and five stars: more difficult exercises (half an hour
         and up).

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Those using SF in a classroom setting should note that the autograder
    assigns extra points to harder exercises:
<br/>
<span class="inlinecode">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 <span class="id" title="var">star</span>  = 1 <span class="id" title="var">point</span><br/>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

</span>
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Some exercises are marked "advanced," and some are marked
    "optional."  Doing just the non-optional, non-advanced exercises
    should provide good coverage of the core material.  Optional
    exercises provide a bit of extra practice with key concepts and
    introduce secondary themes that may be of interest to some
    readers.  Advanced exercises are for readers who want an extra
    challenge and a deeper cut at the material.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

   <span class="loud"> <i>Please do not post solutions to the exercises in a public place</i>. </span>
    Software Foundations is widely used both for self-study and for
    university courses.  Having solutions easily available makes it
    much less useful for courses, which typically have graded homework
    assignments.  We especially request that readers not post
    solutions to the exercises anyplace where they can be found by
    search engines.
