(** *** Some general advice for working on exercises:

    - Most of the Coq proofs we ask you to do are similar to proofs
      that we've provided.  Before starting to work on exercises
      problems, take the time to work through our proofs (both
      informally, on paper, and in Coq) and make sure you understand
      them in detail.  This will save you a lot of time.

    - The Coq proofs we're doing now are sufficiently complicated that
      it is more or less impossible to complete them simply by random
      experimentation or "following your nose."  You need to start
      with an idea about why the property is true and how the proof is
      going to go.  The best way to do this is to write out at least a
      sketch of an informal proof on paper -- one that intuitively
      convinces you of the truth of the theorem -- before starting to
      work on the formal one.  Alternately, grab a friend and try to
      convince them that the theorem is true; then try to formalize
      your explanation.

    - Use automation to save work!  Some of the proofs in this
      chapter's exercises are pretty long if you try to write out all
      the cases explicitly. *)

(** * Behavioral Equivalence *)

(** In an earlier chapter, we investigated the correctness of a very
    simple program transformation: the [optimize_0plus] function.  The
    programming language we were considering was the first version of
    the language of arithmetic expressions -- with no variables -- so
    in that setting it was very easy to define what it means for a
    program transformation to be correct: it should always yield a
    program that evaluates to the same number as the original.

    To go further and talk about the correctness of program
    transformations in the full Imp language, we need to consider the
    role of variables and state. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Definitions *)

(** For [aexp]s and [bexp]s with variables, the definition we want is
    clear.  We say
    that two [aexp]s or [bexp]s are _behaviorally equivalent_ if they
    evaluate to the same result _in every state_. *)

Definition aequiv (a1 a2 : aexp) : Prop :=
  forall (st:state),
    aeval st a1 = aeval st a2.

Definition bequiv (b1 b2 : bexp) : Prop :=
  forall (st:state),
    beval st b1 = beval st b2.

(** For commands, the situation is a little more subtle.  We can't
    simply say "two commands are behaviorally equivalent if they
    evaluate to the same ending state whenever they are started in the
    same initial state," because some commands, when run in some
    starting states, don't terminate in any final state at all!  What
    we need instead is this: two commands are behaviorally equivalent
    if, for any given starting state, they either both diverge or both
    terminate in the same final state.  A compact way to express this
    is "if the first one terminates in a particular state then so does
    the second, and vice versa." *)

Definition cequiv (c1 c2 : com) : Prop :=
  forall (st st' : state),
    (c1 / st \\ st') <-> (c2 / st \\ st').

(** Given the following programs, group together those that are

(** Of course, few programmers would be tempted to write a conditional

    the guard is _equivalent_ to true:

   _Theorem_: If [b] is equivalent to [BTrue], then [IFB b THEN c1
   ELSE c2 FI] is equivalent to [c1].
*)
(**
   _Proof_:

     - ([->]) We must show, for all [st] and [st'], that if [IFB b
       THEN c1 ELSE c2 FI / st \\ st'] then [c1 / st \\ st'].

       Proceed by cases on the rules that could possibly have been
       used to show [IFB b THEN c1 ELSE c2 FI / st \\ st'], namely
       [E_IfTrue] and [E_IfFalse].

       - Suppose the final rule rule in the derivation of [IFB b THEN
         c1 ELSE c2 FI / st \\ st'] was [E_IfTrue].  We then have, by
         the premises of [E_IfTrue], that [c1 / st \\ st'].  This is
         exactly what we set out to prove.

       - On the other hand, suppose the final rule in the derivation
         of [IFB b THEN c1 ELSE c2 FI / st \\ st'] was [E_IfFalse].
         We then know that [beval st b = false] and [c2 / st \\ st'].

         Recall that [b] is equivalent to [BTrue], i.e., forall [st],
         [beval st b = beval st BTrue].  In particular, this means
         that [beval st b = true], since [beval st BTrue = true].  But
         this is a contradiction, since [E_IfFalse] requires that
         [beval st b = false].  Thus, the final rule could not have
         been [E_IfFalse].

     - ([<-]) We must show, for all [st] and [st'], that if [c1 / st
       \\ st'] then [IFB b THEN c1 ELSE c2 FI / st \\ st'].

       Since [b] is equivalent to [BTrue], we know that [beval st b] =
       [beval st BTrue] = [true].  Together with the assumption that
       [c1 / st \\ st'], we can apply [E_IfTrue] to derive [IFB b THEN
       c1 ELSE c2 FI / st \\ st'].  []

   Here is the formal version of this proof: *)

    whose guard is equivalent to [BFalse] is equivalent to [SKIP],

(** To prove the second fact, we need an auxiliary lemma stating that
    [WHILE] loops whose guards are equivalent to [BTrue] never
    terminate:

    _Lemma_: If [b] is equivalent to [BTrue], then it cannot be the
    case that [(WHILE b DO c END) / st \\ st'].

    _Proof_: Suppose that [(WHILE b DO c END) / st \\ st'].  We show,
    by induction on a derivation of [(WHILE b DO c END) / st \\ st'],
    that this assumption leads to a contradiction.

      - Suppose [(WHILE b DO c END) / st \\ st'] is proved using rule
        [E_WhileEnd].  Then by assumption [beval st b = false].  But
        this contradicts the assumption that [b] is equivalent to
        [BTrue].

      - Suppose [(WHILE b DO c END) / st \\ st'] is proved using rule
        [E_WhileLoop].  Then we are given the induction hypothesis
        that [(WHILE b DO c END) / st \\ st'] is contradictory, which
        is exactly what we are trying to prove!

      - Since these are the only rules that could have been used to
        prove [(WHILE b DO c END) / st \\ st'], the other cases of
        the induction are immediately contradictory. [] *)

(** ** Behavioral Equivalence Is a Congruence *)

(** Less obviously, behavioral equivalence is also a _congruence_.
    That is, the equivalence of two subprograms implies the
    equivalence of the larger programs in which they are embedded:

              aequiv a1 a1'
      -----------------------------

    ...and so on for the other forms of commands.

    (Note that we are using the inference rule notation here not as
    part of a definition, but simply to write down some valid
    implications in a readable format. We prove these implications
    below.) *)

(** We will see a concrete example of why these congruence
    properties are important in the following section (in the proof of
    [fold_constants_com_sound]), but the main idea is that they allow
    us to replace a small part of a large program with an equivalent
    small part and know that the whole large programs are equivalent
    _without_ doing an explicit proof about the non-varying parts --
    i.e., the "proof burden" of a small change to a large program is
    proportional to the size of the change, not the program. *)

(** The congruence property for loops is a little more interesting,
    since it requires induction.

    _Theorem_: Equivalence is a congruence for [WHILE] -- that is, if
    [b1] is equivalent to [b1'] and [c1] is equivalent to [c1'], then
    [WHILE b1 DO c1 END] is equivalent to [WHILE b1' DO c1' END].

    _Proof_: Suppose [b1] is equivalent to [b1'] and [c1] is
    equivalent to [c1'].  We must show, for every [st] and [st'], that
    [WHILE b1 DO c1 END / st \\ st'] iff [WHILE b1' DO c1' END / st
    \\ st'].  We consider the two directions separately.

      - ([->]) We show that [WHILE b1 DO c1 END / st \\ st'] implies
        [WHILE b1' DO c1' END / st \\ st'], by induction on a
        derivation of [WHILE b1 DO c1 END / st \\ st'].  The only
        nontrivial cases are when the final rule in the derivation is
        [E_WhileEnd] or [E_WhileLoop].

          - [E_WhileEnd]: In this case, the form of the rule gives us
            [beval st b1 = false] and [st = st'].  But then, since
            [b1] and [b1'] are equivalent, we have [beval st b1' =
            false], and [E-WhileEnd] applies, giving us [WHILE b1' DO
            c1' END / st \\ st'], as required.

          - [E_WhileLoop]: The form of the rule now gives us [beval st
            b1 = true], with [c1 / st \\ st'0] and [WHILE b1 DO c1
            END / st'0 \\ st'] for some state [st'0], with the
            induction hypothesis [WHILE b1' DO c1' END / st'0 \\
            st'].

            Since [c1] and [c1'] are equivalent, we know that [c1' /
            st \\ st'0].  And since [b1] and [b1'] are equivalent, we
            have [beval st b1' = true].  Now [E-WhileLoop] applies,
            giving us [WHILE b1' DO c1' END / st \\ st'], as
            required.

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, optional (fold_bexp_Eq_informal)  *)
(** Here is an informal proof of the [BEq] case of the soundness
    argument for boolean expression constant folding.  Read it
    carefully and compare it to the formal proof that follows.  Then
    fill in the [BLe] case of the formal proof (without looking at the
    [BEq] case, if possible).

   _Theorem_: The constant folding function for booleans,
   [fold_constants_bexp], is sound.

   _Proof_: We must show that [b] is equivalent to [fold_constants_bexp],
   for all boolean expressions [b].  Proceed by induction on [b].  We
   show just the case where [b] has the form [BEq a1 a2].

   In this case, we must show

       beval st (BEq a1 a2)
     = beval st (fold_constants_bexp (BEq a1 a2)).

   There are two cases to consider:

     - First, suppose [fold_constants_aexp a1 = ANum n1] and
       [fold_constants_aexp a2 = ANum n2] for some [n1] and [n2].

       In this case, we have

           fold_constants_bexp (BEq a1 a2)
         = if beq_nat n1 n2 then BTrue else BFalse

       and

           beval st (BEq a1 a2)
         = beq_nat (aeval st a1) (aeval st a2).

       By the soundness of constant folding for arithmetic
       expressions (Lemma [fold_constants_aexp_sound]), we know

           aeval st a1
         = aeval st (fold_constants_aexp a1)
         = aeval st (ANum n1)
         = n1

       and

           aeval st a2
         = aeval st (fold_constants_aexp a2)
         = aeval st (ANum n2)
         = n2,

       so

           beval st (BEq a1 a2)
         = beq_nat (aeval a1) (aeval a2)
         = beq_nat n1 n2.

       Also, it is easy to see (by considering the cases [n1 = n2] and
       [n1 <> n2] separately) that

           beval st (if beq_nat n1 n2 then BTrue else BFalse)
         = if beq_nat n1 n2 then beval st BTrue else beval st BFalse
         = if beq_nat n1 n2 then true else false
         = beq_nat n1 n2.

       So

           beval st (BEq a1 a2)
         = beq_nat n1 n2.
         = beval st (if beq_nat n1 n2 then BTrue else BFalse),

       as required.

     - Otherwise, one of [fold_constants_aexp a1] and
       [fold_constants_aexp a2] is not a constant.  In this case, we
       must show

           beval st (BEq a1 a2)
         = beval st (BEq (fold_constants_aexp a1)
                         (fold_constants_aexp a2)),

       which, by the definition of [beval], is the same as showing

           beq_nat (aeval st a1) (aeval st a2)
         = beq_nat (aeval st (fold_constants_aexp a1))
                   (aeval st (fold_constants_aexp a2)).

       But the soundness of constant folding for arithmetic
       expressions ([fold_constants_aexp_sound]) gives us

         aeval st a1 = aeval st (fold_constants_aexp a1)
         aeval st a2 = aeval st (fold_constants_aexp a2),

       completing the case.  []

(** * Extended Exercise: Nondeterministic Imp *)

(** As we have seen (in theorem [ceval_deterministic] in the [Imp]
    chapter), Imp's evaluation relation is deterministic.  However,
    _non_-determinism is an important part of the definition of many
    real programming languages. For example, in many imperative
    languages (such as C and its relatives), the order in which
    function arguments are evaluated is unspecified.  The program
    fragment

      x = 0;;
      f(++x, x)

    might call [f] with arguments [(1, 0)] or [(1, 1)], depending how
    the compiler chooses to order things.  This can be a little
    confusing for programmers, but it gives the compiler writer useful
    freedom.

    In this exercise, we will extend Imp with a simple
    nondeterministic command and study how this change affects
    program equivalence.  The new command has the syntax [HAVOC X],
    where [X] is an identifier. The effect of executing [HAVOC X] is
    to assign an _arbitrary_ number to the variable [X],
    nondeterministically. For example, after executing the program:

      HAVOC Y;;
      Z ::= Y * 2

    the value of [Y] can be any number, while the value of [Z] is
    twice that of [Y] (so [Z] is always even). Note that we are not
    saying anything about the _probabilities_ of the outcomes -- just
    that there are (infinitely) many different outcomes that can
    possibly happen after executing this nondeterministic code.

    In a sense, a variable on which we do [HAVOC] roughly corresponds
    to an unitialized variable in a low-level language like C.  After
    the [HAVOC], the variable holds a fixed but arbitrary number.  Most
    sources of nondeterminism in language definitions are there
    precisely because programmers don't care which choice is made (and
    so it is good to leave it open to the compiler to choose whichever
    will run faster).

    We call this new language _Himp_ (``Imp extended with [HAVOC]''). *)

    commands. *)

(** The definition of program equivalence we are using here has some

    with nondeterminism, like Himp, some programs always terminate,
    some programs always diverge, and some programs can
    nondeterministically terminate in some runs and diverge in
    others. The final part of the following exercise illustrates this
